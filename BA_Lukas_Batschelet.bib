  abstract = {Social Text 22.2 (2004) 117-139 , How do emotions work to align some subjects with some others and against other others? How do emotions move between bodies? In this essay, I argue that emotions play a crucial role in the "surfacing" of individual and collective bodies through the way in which emotions circulate between bodies and signs. Such an argument clearly challenges any assumption that emotions are a private matter, that they simply belong to individuals, or even that they come from within and then move outward toward others. It suggests that emotions are not simply "within" or "without" but that they create the very effect of the surfaces or boundaries of bodies and worlds., For instance, in the above narrative on the Aryan Nations Web site, the role of emotions, in particular of hate and love, is crucial to the delineation of the bodies of individual subjects and the body of the nation. Here a subject (the white nationalist, the average white man, the white housewife, the white working man, the white citizen, and the white Christian farmer) is presented as endangered by imagined others whose proximity threatens not only to take something away from the subject (jobs, security, wealth), but to take the place of the subject. In other words, the presence of these others is imagined as a threat to the object of love. The narrative involves a rewriting of history, in which the labor of others [End Page 117] (migrants, slaves) is concealed in a fantasy that it is the white subject who "built this land."2 The white subjects claim the place of hosts ("our shores") at the same time as they claim the position of the victim, as the ones who are damaged by an "unmerciful government." The narrative hence suggests that it is love for the nation that makes the white Aryans hate those whom they recognize as strangers, as the ones who are taking away the nation and the role of the Aryans in its history, as well as their future., We might note as well that the reading of others as hateful aligns the imagined subject with rights and the imagined nation with ground. This alignment is affected by the representation of both the rights of the subject and the grounds of the nation as already under threat. It is the emotional reading of hate that works to bind the imagined white subject and nation together. The average white man feels "fear and loathing"; the white housewife, "repulsion and anger"; the white workingman, "curses"; the white Christian farmer, "rage." The passion of these negative attachments to others is redefined simultaneously as a positive attachment to the imagined subjects brought together through the repetition of the signifier, "white." It is the love of white, or those recognizable as white, that supposedly explains this shared "communal" visceral response of hate. Together we hate, and this hate is what makes...},

  abstract = {In this paper I reflect on the concept of affective atmospheres in the context of the distinction between affect and emotion that has emerged in recent work on emotion, space and society. The concept of atmosphere is interesting because it holds a series of opposites -- presence and absence, materiality and ideality, definite and indefinite, singularity and generality -- in a relation of tension. To develop this account of atmosphere I juxtapose Marx's materialist imagination with a phenomenology attentive to singular affective qualities. By invoking a material imagination based on the movement and lightness of air, we learn from the former about the turbulence of atmospheres and their indeterminate quality. From the latter, we learn that atmospheres are singular affective qualities that emanate from but exceed the assembling of bodies. As such, to attend to affective atmospheres is to learn to be affected by the ambiguities of affect/emotion, by that which is determinate and indeterminate, present and absent, singular and vague.},

  abstract = {Socioeconomic, ethnic and gender disparities in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) risk are well established but no studies have applied multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) within an intersectional framework to study this outcome. We study individuals at the first level of analysis and combinations of multiple social and demographic categorizations (i.e., intersectional strata) at the second level of analysis. Here we used MAIHDA to assess to what extent individual differences in the propensity of developing COPD are at the intersectional strata level. We also used MAIHDA to determine the degree of similarity in COPD incidence of individuals in the same intersectional stratum. This leads to an improved understanding of risk heterogeneity and of the social dynamics driving socioeconomic and demographic disparities in COPD incidence. Using data from 2,445,501 residents in Sweden aged 45–65, we constructed 96 intersectional strata combining categories of age, gender, income, education, civil- and migration status. The incidences of COPD ranged from 0.02\% for young, native males with high income and high education who cohabited to 0.98\% for older native females with low income and low education who lived alone. We calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) that informs on the discriminatory accuracy of the categorizations. In a model that conflated additive and interaction effects, the ICC was good (20.0\%). In contrast, in a model that measured only interaction effects, the ICC was poor (1.1\%) suggesting that most of the observed differences in COPD incidence across strata are due to the main effects of the categories used to construct the intersectional matrix while only a minor share of the differences are attributable to intersectional interactions. We found conclusive interaction effects. The intersectional MAIHDA approach offers improved information to guide public health policies in COPD prevention, and such policies should adopt an intersectional perspective.},

  abstract = {This article shows how activists in the open data movement re-articulate notions of democracy, participation, and journalism by applying practices and values from open source culture to the creation and use of data. Focusing on the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics. Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors outside big government and big business.},

  note = {Baack analysiert, wie das Open-Data-Movement zentrale Vorstellungen von Demokratie, Partizipation und Journalismus neu definiert. Er argumentiert, dass die Bewegung zwar den Anspruch hat, Empowerment und Transparenz durch offene Daten zu fördern, dabei aber technokratische und elitäre Logiken reproduziert.
\par
\textbf{Hauptargumente:}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Re-Artikulation von Demokratie:}\\
Open Data wird als Mittel präsentiert, um bürgerliche Partizipation zu stärken. Doch anstelle einer substantiellen Demokratisierung betont die Bewegung oft ein datenbasiertes Verständnis von Rationalität und Evidenz, das demokratische Prozesse auf technisches Wissen und quantitative Logik reduziert.
\item \textbf{Technologischer Determinismus:}\\
Viele Diskurse im Open-Data-Kontext unterstellen, dass Transparenz und Empowerment automatisch aus Offenheit folgen. Baack kritisiert diese Vorstellung als deterministisch und zeigt auf, dass technisches Wissen und Zugang zu Infrastruktur ungleich verteilt sind.
\item \textbf{Wandel journalistischer Praktiken:}\\
Der Autor beschreibt, wie datenjournalistische Projekte zwar neue Formen investigativer Recherche ermöglichen, gleichzeitig aber hohe technische Einstiegshürden erzeugen, die nicht alle Akteur:innen überwinden können. Dies führt zu neuen Machtasymmetrien innerhalb des Journalismus.
\item \textbf{Partizipation und Expertise:}\\
Die Bewegung fördert ein Modell von Partizipation, das auf technischer Kompetenz basiert. Dies bevorzugt privilegierte Gruppen, insbesondere solche mit technischem oder wissenschaftlichem Hintergrund, und schliesst marginalisierte Stimmen strukturell aus.

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Fazit:}\\
Obwohl die Open-Data-Bewegung emanzipatorische Ziele verfolgt, bleibt sie häufig in einem neoliberalen Technikverständnis gefangen. Baack ruft dazu auf, das Versprechen digitaler Partizipation kritisch zu reflektieren und stärker auf soziale Gerechtigkeit, Inklusion und machtkritische Perspektiven zu fokussieren.},

We developed a smartphone-based tool (Urban Mind; www.urbanmind.info) to examine how exposure to natural features within the built environment affects mental well-being in real time. The tool was used to monitor 108 individuals who completed 3013 assessments over a 1-week period. Significant immediate and lagged associations with mental well-being were found for several natural features. These associations were stronger in people with higher trait impulsivity, a psychological measure of one's tendency to behave with little forethought or consideration of the consequences, which is indicative of a higher risk of developing mental-health issues. Our investigation suggests that the benefits of nature on mental well-being are time-lasting and interact with an individual's vulnerability to mental illness. These findings have potential implications from the perspectives of global mental health as well as urban planning and design.},

Already at the very beginning, women of color as well as LGBTQ people rightly criticized that they were not visible and did not feel properly represented in a women’s movement that seemed to occupy mainly the essentializing speaking position of White heterosexual middle-class women.},

We published a pair of articles on methods for intercategorical intersectionality, in which we distinguished analytic from descriptive studies, identified causal mediation decomposition methods as an appropriate strategy for analytic intercategorical intersectionality, and introduced and validated a group of three new measures of major, day-to-day, and anticipated discrimination for use in intercategorical analysis (Bauer and Scheim, 2019; Scheim and Bauer, 2019). We respond to points raised in four invited commentaries on our original pair of articles—by Evans (2019); Jackson and VanderWeele (2019); Harnois and Bastos (2019); and Richman and Zucker (2019). We discuss differential constructs, which represent those that exist only for those at particular intersections, or for which meanings vary across intersections. Whereas such constructs may be studied intracategorically, in intercategorical studies they place limits on both the types of measures that may be used and the statistical analyses that can be conducted. Most quantitative intersectionality methods work has therefore focused on intracategorical measures, but intercategorical analyses. We present a preliminary agenda for continued methods development in quantitative intersectionality methods.},

  abstract = {Background Intersectionality is a theoretical framework rooted in the premise that human experience is jointly shaped by multiple social positions (e.g. race, gender), and cannot be adequately understood by considering social positions independently. Used widely in qualitative studies, its uptake in quantitative research has been more recent. Objectives To characterize quantitative research applications of intersectionality from 1989 to mid-2020, to evaluate basic integration of theoretical frameworks, and to identify innovative methods that could be applied to health research. Methods Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles indexed within Scopus, Medline, ProQuest Political Science and Public Administration, and PsycINFO. Original English-language quantitative or mixed-methods research or methods papers that explicitly applied intersectionality theoretical frameworks were included. Experimental studies on perception/stereotyping and measures development or validation studies were excluded. We extracted data related to publication, study design, quantitative methods, and application of intersectionality. Results 707 articles (671 applied studies, 25 methods-only papers, 11 methods plus application) met inclusion criteria. Articles were published in journals across a range of disciplines, most commonly psychology, sociology, and medical/life sciences; 40.8\% studied a health-related outcome. Results supported concerns among intersectionality scholars that core theoretical tenets are often lost or misinterpreted in quantitative research; about one in four applied articles (26.9\%) failed to define intersectionality, while one in six (17.5\%) included intersectional position components not reflective of social power. Quantitative methods were simplistic (most often regression with interactions, cross-classified variables, or stratification) and were often misapplied or misinterpreted. Several novel methods were identified. Conclusions Intersectionality is frequently misunderstood when bridging theory into quantitative methodology. Further work is required to (1) ensure researchers understand key features that define quantitative intersectionality analyses, (2) improve reporting practices for intersectional analyses, and (3) develop and adapt quantitative methods.},

However, it has so far not been applied to longitudinal data, despite the availability of such data, and growing recognition that intersectional social processes and determinants are not static, unchanging phenomena. Drawing on intersectionality and life-course theories, we develop a longitudinal version of the intersectional MAIHDA approach, allowing the analysis not just of intersectional inequalities in static individual differences, but also of life-course trajectories. We discuss the conceptualisation of intersectional groups in this context: how they are changeable over the life-course, appropriate treatment of generational differences, and relevance of the age-period-cohort identification problem. We illustrate the approach with a study of mental health using United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study data. The results reveal important differences in trajectories between generations and intersectional strata, and show that trajectories are partly multiplicative but mostly additive in their intersectional inequalities. This article provides an important and much needed methodological contribution, enabling rigorous quantitative, longitudinal, intersectional analyses in social epidemiology and beyond.},

We addressed the following questions: Are visits to canals and rivers associated with higher levels of mental wellbeing? Does this association depend on age and gender? Does this association vary between people with and without a diagnosis on mental illness? We used Urban Mind, a flexible smartphone application for examining the impact of different aspects of the built and social environment on mental wellbeing, a strong predictor of mental health. Participants were invited to complete an ecological momentary assessment three times a day for fourteen days. Each assessment included questions about their surrounding environment and mental wellbeing. A total of 7,975 assessments were completed by 299 participants including 87 with a diagnosis of mental illness. Multilevel regression models were used to analyse the data. We found positive associations between visits to canals and rivers and mental wellbeing (p {$<$} .05) when compared to being anywhere else and when compared to being in green spaces. Increases in mental wellbeing were still evident after the visit had taken place. These effects remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity and education, and were consistent in people with and without a diagnosis of mental illness. Spending time near canals and rivers is associated with better mental wellbeing. These findings have potential implications for mental health as well as urban planning and policy. Visits to canals and rivers could become part of social prescribing schemes, playing a role in preventing mental health difficulties and complementing more traditional interventions.},

One of the most influential contemporary social class schemas is the EGP (Erikson–Goldthorpe–Portocarero) schema. As we saw in Chapter 1, ESeC is essentially an update of EGP. One obvious disadvantage with the EGP schema is that there is no commonly agreed way of operationalizing it, since at the time of its construction quite different standards of occupational classifications were used across countries (cf. Erikson and Goldthorpe 1992). The most widely used algorithm for coding EGP was developed by Ganzeboom and Treiman, who use ISCO-88 (COM) as a starting point (Ganzeboom and Treiman 1996: 204–205). Hence, ESeC and EGP not only have the same theoretical base but also, at least so far as the EGP operationalization by Ganzeboom and Treiman is concerned, both are derived through a combination of the ISCO code and similar additional information. As a result, we are led to believe that the two schemas will be quite similar. Furthermore, if ESeC is viewed as an update of EGP we might expect it to be at least somewhat better in predicting class relevant outcomes. Consequently, the overall purpose of this chapter is to contribute to the validation of the ESeC class schema by comparing it with EGP. The analyses are based on the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 2.},

Reports were sent in real time using a smartphone application during an eight-month period. The results, based on over 5000 experience samples, indicate that subjective momentary experiences, particularly sense of comfort and sense of security, are highly influenced by situational variables and environmental characteristics including type of activity and environment, place characteristics, and company. Surprisingly, personality variables which are considered to be a main determinant of wellbeing and general life satisfaction were found to be non-significant in the multilevel models that were implemented. This finding further supports the notion that momentary experiences greatly differ from general evaluations of subjective wellbeing.},

  abstract = {This paper presents some relevant tools for UN-HABITAT CPI, addressing the relationship between residential neighbourhood assessment, neighbourhood attachment and overall residential satisfaction of residents in the Iranian the city of Tabriz. The first aim of the study is to validate some cross-cultural tools~–~focusing on the Quality of Life (QOL) spoke of the CPI's wheel of urban prosperity – for use in an urban residential context (Fornara et~al., 2010); specifically an abbreviated version of the Perceived Residential Environment Quality Indicators (PREQIs) and the Neighbourhood Attachment Scale (NAS), as well as items for measurement of Residential Satisfaction (RS). The instruments consist of 11 scales measuring PREQIs, one scale measuring Neighbourhood Attachment and three items about RS. The second aim is to test a model of the links among the constructs measured by these tools that deal with different features of QOL. For example, if some global PREQIs (i.e., pace of life) mediate the relationship between other, more specific PREQIs and Neighbourhood Attachment; and then if they ultimately predict RS, they may be considered as final outcome criteria. PREQIs, NAS and RS items are included in a self-report questionnaire, (translated from English into Farsi language) and then administered to 239 residents of Tabriz, Iran. Multivariate statistical analyses of the survey results extends the cross-cultural validity of the tools, as well as testing relationship models going from specific to global PREQIs, to NAS, finally predicting RS. The discussion argues for the relevance of PREQIs, NAS and RS constructs and tools in deepening the knowledge on the QOL spoke within the UN-HABITAT CPI.},

Applying this consideration to the workplace, we explore ways in which status-based and structural aspects of work undermine women and people with physical disabilities and diminish psychological well-being. We conceptually integrate research on the workplace disadvantages experienced by women and people with disabilities. Drawing on a longitudinal analysis of community survey data that includes a diverse sample of people with and without physical disabilities, we explore the claim that women with disabilities are burdened by greater disadvantage in work settings compared to men with disabilities and women and men without disabilities. We find evidence that in comparison with these groups, women with disabilities on average are more psychologically affected by inequitable workplace conditions, partly because they earn less, are exposed to more workplace stress, and are less likely to experience autonomous working conditions.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT null Introduction Urban youth are experiencing increasing mental health problems due to diverse personal, social and environmental concerns. Youths’ detachment from natural environments, including green and blue spaces, may intensify such issues further. Contact with nature can benefit mental health and promote pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). Yet, only a few studies assess these relationships among the youth usually ignoring effects of living in diverse urban contexts, and everyday nature experiences. ECO-MIND will investigate whether urban youth’s dynamic greenspace exposure and their mental models about nature connectedness explain the associations between greenspace exposure, mental health and PEB in multiple urban contexts. Methods and analysis We will collect data from university students from the Global South (ie, Dhaka, Kampala) and Global North cities (ie, Utrecht). Participants aged 18–24 will be recruited through stratified random sampling. We will use geographic ecological momentary assessment to assess respondents’ everyday experiences and exposure to greenspaces. Our definition of greenspace exposure will be based on the availability, accessibility and visibility of greenspaces extracted from satellite and street view images. We will administer a baseline questionnaire to participants about mental health, nature connectedness and PEB characteristics. Further, we will ask participants to build mental models to show their perception of nature connectedness. Finally, we will fit partial least square structural equation models and multi-level models to our longitudinal geographic momentary assessment data. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Utrecht University (Geo S-23221). Informed consent must be given freely, without coercion and based on a clear understanding of the participation in the study. Findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at conferences. Furthermore, we will implement public engagement activities (eg, panel discussion) to share results among local stakeholders and policymakers and cocreate policy briefs.},

  abstract = {Well-being (WB) extends beyond physical health, as defined by the World Health Organization and encompasses two aspects: (1) long-term WB (LWB), such as overall life satisfaction; and (2) momentary WB (MWB), such as immediate mood. While research has demonstrated a positive association between one’s environment and LWB, limited studies have explored the association between environmental characteristics and MWB. We applied the experience sampling method (ESM) to collect data on location, perceived environmental characteristics, MWB, and LWB of adult participants living in Kashiwa-no-ha area, Kashiwa City, Japan. Structural equation modeling was used to calculate the correlation coefficients between different environments and both MWB and LWB. LWB was positively associated with MWB (standardized coefficient=0.24) and urban elements—cafés/restaurants/bars (0.11), cultural/sports/education facilities (0.04), and public spaces (0.11). Meanwhile, relaxing/clean (0.56) and natural environments (0.14) were associated with higher MWB. Conversely, vibrant environments (−0.14) and being on the move (−0.11) were linked to lower MWB. LWB was positively associated with being at cultural/sports/educational facilities (0.06), and vibrant (0.15) and communicative (0.13) urban settings. MWB was associated with various built environments, emphasizing the need for places like parks and cafés that promote a positive mood, and well-designed transportation and roads. These elements are important for developing urban areas that meet the physical requirements of residents while supporting their emotional and psychological well-being.},

In this paper, we review and analyze historical and contemporary “safe spaces”. These include “separatist” safe spaces in women's, anti-racist, and feminist communities, “inclusive” safe space classrooms, and safe spaces in which (non-human) objects are central. We argue that safe spaces should be understood not through static and acontextual notions of “safe” or “unsafe”, but rather through the relational work of cultivating them. Such an understanding reveals several tendencies. Namely, safe spaces are inherently paradoxical. Cultivating them includes foregrounding social differences and binaries (safe–unsafe, inclusive–exclusive) as well as recognizing the porosity of such binaries. Renegotiating these binaries is necessarily incomplete; a safe space is never completely safe. Even so, we encourage the critical cultivation of safe space as a site for negotiating difference and challenging oppression.},

A variety of conceptualizations of psychological health have been proposed including hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, quality-of-life, and wellness approaches. Although instruments for measuring constructs associated with each of these approaches have been developed, there has been no comprehensive review of well-being measures. The present literature review was undertaken to identify self-report instruments measuring well-being or closely related constructs (i.e., quality of life and wellness) and critically evaluate them with regard to their conceptual basis and psychometric properties. Through a literature search, we identified 42 instruments that varied significantly in length, psychometric properties, and their conceptualization and operationalization of well-being. Results suggest that there is considerable disagreement regarding how to properly understand and measure well-being. Research and clinical implications are discussed.},

The Experience-Sampling Method (ESM) is an attempt to provide a valid instrument to describe variations in self-reports of mental processes. It can be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity, and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional, cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of thought disturbance. The article reviews pratical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short-and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the technique can be usefully applied.},

It takes as a key case study the RealTech company Juwai; one of the largest transnational digital platforms connecting international estate agents and Chinese buyers. Positioning the digital platform as a site in which multiple cultural and geographic knowledges are produced and articulated as a condition for value extraction, the paper analyses a suite of textual and visual content in both English and Mandarin produced on Juwai that targets Chinese buyers and the Australian real estate industry. The core argument is that the production of cultural difference or cultural asymmetry is not simply a by-product of Juwai’s form of platform capitalism, rather mediating cultural asymmetries is a process of value extraction that is a central component of their business model. We point to a business model of ‘cultural platform capitalism’ where the technology exceeds its conventional connective and extractive functions (i.e., data as value) by translating cultural knowledge as a key business practice (i.e., cultural risk as value).},

  abstract = {Feminicide is the gender-related killing of cisgender and transgender women and girls. It reflects patriarchal and racialized systems of oppression and reveals how territories and socio-economic landscapes configure everyday gender-related violence. In recent decades, many grassroots data production initiatives have emerged with the aim of monitoring this extreme but invisibilized phenomenon. We bridge scholarship in feminist and information geographies with data feminism to examine the ways in which space, broadly defined, shapes the counterdata production strategies of feminicide data activists. Drawing on a qualitative study of 33 monitoring efforts led by civil society organizations across 15 countries, primarily in Latin America, we provide a conceptual framework for examining the spatial dimensions of data activism. We show how there are striking transnational patterns related to where feminicide goes unrecorded, resulting in geographies of missing data. In response to these omissions, activists deploy multiple spatialized strategies to make these geographies visible, to situate and contextualize each case of feminicide, to reclaim databases as spaces for memory and witnessing, and to build transnational networks of solidarity. In this sense, we argue that data activism about feminicide constitutes a space of resistance and resignification of everyday forms of gender-related violence.},

  note = {Das Paper untersucht, wie fehlende Daten – also Datenlücken, Auslassungen oder systematische Leerstellen – nicht nur technische, sondern zutiefst politische und räumliche Phänomene darstellen. Die Autor*innen plädieren für eine geographisch informierte Analyse von sogenannten „Counterdata“-Bewegungen, also Initiativen, die bewusst alternative, häufig feministische oder dekoloniale Datensätze produzieren, um dominante Infrastrukturen zu hinterfragen.
\par
\textbf{Zentrale Argumente:}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Fehlende Daten sind nicht zufällig, sondern spiegeln Machtverhältnisse wider: Bestimmte Körper, Orte oder Erfahrungen werden systematisch nicht erfasst, weil sie als irrelevant gelten oder nicht in dominante Wissenssysteme passen.
\item Diese Leerstelle ist nicht nur ein Defizit, sondern ein Ausdruck epistemischer Gewalt – besonders gegenüber marginalisierten Gruppen.
\item Die Autor*innen schlagen vor, fehlende Daten als \mkbibemph{geographies of absence} zu begreifen, also als räumlich produzierte und verortete Ausdrucksformen sozialer Ausschlüsse.
\item Counterdata-Projekte – wie etwa feministische Mapping-Initiativen, queere Datenarchive oder indigene Kartierungsprojekte – versuchen, diese Lücken bewusst zu füllen. Sie produzieren nicht nur neue Daten, sondern stellen die Grundlagen von Datenproduktion, -infrastruktur und -ethik infrage.

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Relevanz für kritische Geographie:}\\
Das Paper verbindet feministische epistemologische Perspektiven mit räumlicher Analyse und legt dar, wie alternative Datenpraktiken nicht nur methodisch, sondern auch politisch transformativ sein können. Es fordert eine Geographie der Datenlücken – nicht nur um Abwesenheiten zu identifizieren, sondern um zu zeigen, wo und wie Wissen systematisch unterdrückt oder unsichtbar gemacht wird.
\par
\textbf{Bezug zur eigenen Arbeit:}\\
Die Analyse der \mkbibemph{geographies of missing data} unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit einer bewussten, gerechteren Datenpraxis. Gerade bei der Entwicklung eigener Tools oder Befragungsinstrumente wird deutlich, dass schon die Frage, \mkbibemph{was} überhaupt erhoben wird, politisch ist. Das Paper liefert damit eine wichtige theoretische Grundlage für die Argumentation zugunsten einer feministischen, reflexiven Datenpraxis.},

The results of our study reveal a “high-inside, low-outside” pattern of quality of life, characterised by higher standards of living in the central districts and lower standards at the city's periphery.},

For those privileged enough to have nearby and safe access to natural environments, green and blue spaces have become an important enabler of everyday wellbeing. In this paper we explore the role of everyday interactions with nature for the maintenance of wellbeing, during the first and second ‘wave’ of infections in the Netherlands. Based on qualitative interviews with 30 participants in spring/summer and autumn of 2020, we detail how relationships with nature in the local surroundings and in the home qualitatively and effectively changed in response to COVID-19 induced confinement, resulting in the becoming-therapeutic of everyday micro-geographies. Amongst our participants, the conditions of semi-lockdown gave rise to increased interactions with nature, both in their outdoor surroundings and in the home. These increased interactions also led to intensified emotional and sensory experiences with nature and a greater sense of familiarity with their surroundings, which strengthened place-attachments and contributed to an increased sense of wellbeing.},

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls "embodied interaction"--an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality--reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.},

Simultaneously, we acknowledge the resounding whiteness and heteronormativity of these theoretical origins. In the second half of the article, we trace new horizons of contemporary digital geographies scholarship that engage queer and critical race theory, postcolonial feminism, and black and queer code studies. These theoretical moves give voice to longstanding silences and are indispensable to a political and ethical digital geographic scholarship and praxis, as well as to re-making our technologies and ourselves as digital subjects.},

  abstract = {Intersectional multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (I-MAIHDA) is an innovative approach for investigating inequalities, including intersectional inequalities in health, disease, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and other outcomes. I-MAIHDA and related MAIHDA approaches have conceptual and methodological advantages over conventional single-level regression analysis. By enabling the study of inequalities produced by numerous interlocking systems of marginalization and oppression, and by addressing many of the limitations of studying interactions in conventional analyses, intersectional MAIHDA provides a valuable analytical tool in social epidemiology, health psychology, precision medicine and public health, environmental justice, and beyond. The approach allows for estimation of average differences between intersectional strata (stratum inequalities), in-depth exploration of interaction effects, as well as decomposition of the total individual variation (heterogeneity) in individual outcomes within and between strata. Specific advice for conducting and interpreting MAIHDA models has been scattered across a burgeoning literature. We consolidate this knowledge into an accessible conceptual and applied tutorial for studying both continuous and binary individual outcomes. We emphasize I-MAIHDA in our illustration, however this tutorial is also informative for understanding related approaches, such as multicategorical MAIHDA, which has been proposed for use in clinical research and beyond. The tutorial will support readers who wish to perform their own analyses and those interested in expanding their understanding of the approach. To demonstrate the methodology, we provide step-by-step analytical advice and present an illustrative health application using simulated data. We provide the data and syntax to replicate all our analyses.},

At the same time, data sharing in research is attributed a vast potential for scientific progress. It allows the reproducibility of study results and the reuse of old data for new research questions. Based on a systematic review of 98 scholarly papers and an empirical survey among 603 secondary data users, we develop a conceptual framework that explains the process of data sharing from the primary researcher's point of view. We show that this process can be divided into six descriptive categories: Data donor, research organization, research community, norms, data infrastructure, and data recipients . Drawing from our findings, we discuss theoretical implications regarding knowledge creation and dissemination as well as research policy measures to foster academic collaboration. We conclude that research data cannot be regarded a knowledge commons, but research policies that better incentivize data sharing are needed to improve the quality of research results and foster scientific progress.},

  abstract = {Städte weisen durch ihre räumlichen Charakteristika eine erhöhte Wärmebelastung auf, was ein Risiko für die städtische Bevölkerung und Infrastruktur darstellt. Damit Städte zukünftig in Anbetracht des Klimawandels lebenswert bleiben, muss die Wärmebelastung durch eine klimaangepasste Stadtgestaltung minimiert werden. Dies ist insbesondere in öffentlichen Räumen wichtig, weil diese einen zentralen Bestandteil städtischer Lebensqualität darstellen. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht die Verknüpfung zwischen thermischem Empfinden und öffentlichen Räumen in den Quartieren Bümpliz und Breitenrain der Stadt Bern. Mittels Fragebogen und Mental Mapping wurden die Auswirkungen städtischer Strukturen, mikroklimatischer Aufwertungsmassnahmen und deren thermischen Eigenschaften auf die subjektive Wahrnehmung des öffentlichen Raumes an heissen Sommertagen analysiert. Die Ergebnisse betonen die Bedeutung von Grünräumen, Bäumen, Schatten und Wasser für das thermische Empfinden und das Wohlbefinden. Verkehrsbelastete Strassen und stark versiegelte Flächen ohne grüne Infrastruktur, die eine starke bis extreme Wärmebelastung aufweisen, werden als unangenehm empfunden. Die Bewertung der Quartiersgestaltung ergab eine mässige Zufriedenheit und Potenzial zur Verbesserung bezüglich des Angebots und der bisherigen Umsetzung mikroklimatischer Aufwertungsmassnahmen. Die Arbeit liefert wichtige Erkenntnisse darüber, wie thermische Faktoren und weitere Umweltbedingungen das Wohlbefinden in verschiedenen Quartieren beeinflussen. Diese Erkenntnisse können zur Entwicklung gezielter Massnahmen zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität in Städten beitragen. Die Arbeit betont zudem die Notwendigkeit, psychologische und soziale Aspekte des thermischen Empfindens bei städtischen Planungsprozessen zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel zu berücksichtigen.},

  abstract = {Place-based socio-economic and racial inequities contribute to health disparities among people with HIV (PWH). We used geographic ecological momentary assessment (GEMA) methodologies to explore the interplay between psychosocial outcomes in daily diaries and community spatial measures among PWH in New Orleans. PWH (N = 69) were recruited from a clinic-based cohort study. Micro-longitudinal data were collected via smartphone-based daily diaries and geospatial tracking over 14 days. First, correlations were run between diary derived outcomes (e.g., feeling safe in current location, stress), and spatial measures (e.g., violent crime, alcohol outlets, and vacant lots) within a half-mile buffer around each diary point to understand the real time associations between mood and space. Next, we fit multilevel models, controlling for between-person effects, to assess within-person associations between accumulative spatial daily violence exposure (50m, 100m and 200m buffers), and measures of daily mood and coping. Violent crime, alcohol outlets and vacant lots were inversely correlated with feeling safe and positively correlated with perceived ease of obtaining drugs. Vacant lots were positively associated with stress and inversely correlated with positive mood. Within individuals, higher daily accumulated violence exposure was associated with increased rumination at the 50m buffer level, decreased trust in oneself and others at the 100m buffer, and decreased ratio of positive/negative mood at all buffers. Our results emphasize the intricate interplay between mental wellness, coping mechanisms, and spatial measures in PWH. Future research and interventions for PWH should consider how spatial factors may influence PWH in terms of mental health and care engagement.},

  abstract = {“Digital sovereignty” has become a buzzword in digital policies. Contrary to the imaginary of digital transformation as preceding an era of limitless global networking in the 1990s, approaches to state regulation and delimitation of data flows as well as programmes for national digital infrastructures are justified with calls for digital sovereignty across very different contexts. This forum brings together contributions from political geography, law, computer science, and ethics that compare and analyse discourses and practices of digital sovereignty. The case studies on Russia and the EU reveal parallels as well as fundamental differences in the conception and implementation of digital sovereignty. Essays on the challenges posed by new forms of cross-border interaction (such as cloud computing) and new actors (such as digital platforms) illustrate that the traditional coupling of concepts of sovereignty, territoriality and the state, of jurisdiction and borders, must be rethought. The essays in this forum thus make it clear that the digital transformation is not simply a socio-technical modernisation process. It is rather shaped in specific ways and should be understood and analysed as (geo)-political discourses and practices. The forum contributes to the development of a political digital geography that analyses how the digital transformation is contested and produced in specific ways and unearths the politics and spatialities conceived and produced in these discourses and practices.},

Emphasizing that bodily sovereignty is integral to data sovereignty, feminist intervention has sought to tackle such violations of personhood by putting bodies back into data governance debates. This paper by Anita Gurumurthy and Nandini Chami demonstrates that such an approach may not be adequate to challenge the relations of domination encoded in data. It argues that what is needed, instead, is a shift in focus from reclaiming the materiality of embodiment to restructuring the material relations of data as a social knowledge commons. Centering a feminist relational ontology and ethics, the paper offers some concrete directions for collective social control over the health data commons. It shows how, in the final analysis, equality of autonomy in the datafied social is predicated on an expanded idea of data sovereignty – one that promotes the public commons of social knowledge, even as it strives to prevent incursions into the private space.},

  abstract = {Disabled people experience significant social discrimination and spatial exclusion in their everyday lives in the city. In recent years, discriminatory acts have increasingly been labelled as 'hate crimes'. We argue that hate crime's association with harassment and violence has obscured the more common prejudicial attitudes and actions, which create anxiety and fear. Further, the paper seeks to shift the disability hate crime discourse from its present focus on individual victimisation, to the micro and local spaces, social relations and wider socio-political contexts, within which these acts emerge. We set out a critique of hate crime discourse, offering instead a relational interpretation of people's experiences of place, drawing on aspects of non-representational theory. We argue that everyday movements through the city and encounters with others, produce senses of anxiety and precarity, as well as experiences of belonging, in the context of structural disablist attitudes. The paper draws on a collaborative research project in a city centre in Scotland, using a methodology of walking interviews and focus groups. The findings are presented in four themes, illustrated by qualitative GIS mapping: (i) recorded and experienced hate crime and harassment in the city; (ii) routes into and mobility within the city; (iii) spaces of fear and anxiety, and inclusion and welcome; and (iv) encounters and relations with others. We conclude by arguing that a relational approach, examining the dynamic unfolding or emergence of people's embodied and emotional experiences and encounters (both negative and positive), in a range of contexts, is a significant contribution to the hate crime debate.},

  abstract = {Loneliness is a major public health concern with links to social and environmental factors. Previous studies have typically investigated loneliness as a stable emotional state using retrospective cross-sectional designs. Yet people experience different levels of loneliness throughout the day depending on their surrounding environment. In the present study, we investigated the associations between loneliness and social and environmental factors (i.e. overcrowding, population density, social inclusivity and contact with nature) in real-time. Ecological momentary assessment data was collected from participants using the Urban Mind smartphone application. Data from 756 participants who completed 16,602 assessments between April 2018 and March 2020 were used in order to investigate associations between momentary feeling of loneliness, the social environment (i.e. overcrowding, social inclusivity, population density) and the built environment (i.e. contact with nature) using multilevel modelling. Increased overcrowding and population density were associated with higher levels of loneliness; in contrast, social inclusivity and contact with nature were associated with lower levels of loneliness. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education and occupation. The positive association between social inclusivity and lower levels of loneliness was more pronounced when participants were in contact with nature, indicating an interaction between the social and built environment on loneliness. The feeling of loneliness changes in relation to both social and environmental factors. Our findings have potential implications for public health strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the burden of loneliness on society. Specific measures, which would increase social inclusion and contact with nature while reducing overcrowding, should be implemented, especially in densely populated cities.},

Previous studies have typically relied on retrospective questionnaires or artificial set-ups with little ecological validity. In the present study, we used the Urban Mind smartphone application to examine the impact of seeing or hearing birds on self-reported mental wellbeing in real-life contexts. A sample of 1292 participants completed a total of 26,856 ecological momentary assessments between April 2018 and October 2021. Everyday encounters with birdlife were associated with time-lasting improvements in mental wellbeing. These improvements were evident not only in healthy people but also in those with a diagnosis of depression, the most common mental illness across the world. These findings have potential implications for both environmental and wildlife protection and mental healthcare policies. Specific measures, aimed at preserving and increasing everyday encounters with birdlife in urban areas, should be implemented.},

  abstract = {In the past twenty years, intersectionality has emerged as a compelling response to arguments on behalf of identity-based politics across the discipline. It has done so by drawing attention to the simultaneous and interacting effects of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, and national origin as categories of difference. Intersectional arguments and research findings have had varying levels of impact in feminist theory, social movements, international human rights, public policy, and electoral behavior research within political science and across the disciplines of sociology, critical legal studies, and history. Yet consideration of intersectionality as a research paradigm has yet to gain a wide foothold in political science. This article closely reads research on race and gender across subfields of political science to present a coherent set of empirical research standards for intersectionality.Ange-Marie Hancock is Assistant Professor of Political Science \& African American Studies at Yale University (ange-marie.hancock@yale.edu).

The emotions can be mobilised to serve entrenched interests or challenge power hierarchies in social life, including through digitally mediated spaces. Whether in real or digital life, emotional labour and emotion work are constitutive of temporality, sociality and spatiality. The report concludes by reflecting on what ‘caring-with’ the emotions means for our institutions and the international academy.},

In particular, these perspectives facilitate analyses of power imbalances and value extraction across territories—an under-theorized aspect within platform studies. We theorize this dynamic by introducing the descriptor ‘digital value network’ (DVN): a digitally mediated nexus of platform operations that produce and distribute value between territories, on the basis of labour transactions. Empirically, we draw on a multi-year action research project, assessing the operations of platforms and the experiences of platform workers in 54 countries. Our analysis highlights that platforms as lead firms extend GVC/GPN logics of coordination and drivenness in DVN to (i) optimize production capabilities while externalizing ownership and costs, (ii) accumulate both monetary and non-monetary forms of value, and (iii) concentrate power at the global scale in both existing and new sectors.},

We argue there has been an ontological and epistemological impasse in ‘alcohol studies’ between approaches that have considered the biological, physiological and psychological impacts of alcohol consumption and those focused on social and cultural practices. While there has been an artificial separation, and hence under-theorisation of the relationships between emotions, embodiment, affect and everyday uses of alcohol, we develop an argument that signals the possibilities of a more nuanced and sophisticated approach. We present empirical research from the UK and offer theoretical, methodological and policy-relevant conclusions.},

Can well-being be measured by a subjective survey, even approximately? In this paper, we discuss research on how individuals' responses to subjective well-being questions vary with their circumstances and other factors. We will argue that it is fruitful to distinguish among different conceptions of utility rather than presume to measure a single, unifying concept that motivates all human choices and registers all relevant feelings and experiences. While various measures of well-being are useful for some purposes, it is important to recognize that subjective well-being measures features of individuals' perceptions of their experiences, not their utility as economists typically conceive of it. Those perceptions are a more accurate gauge of actual feelings if they are reported closer to the time of, and in direct reference to, the actual experience. We conclude by proposing the U- index, a misery index of sorts, which measures the proportion of time that people spend in an unpleasant state, and has the virtue of not requiring a cardinal conception of individuals' feelings.},

We collected data from 221 participants from two communities in Hong Kong, i.e., Sham Shui Po (SSP) and Tin Shui Wai (TSW), using a stratified random sampling approach. Big datasets were also used to derive relevant built-environment features at the street block level. We used structural equation modeling to explore the complex relationships among housing characteristics, built-environment features, and mental health. The results indicate that the associations between built-environment quality and people’s mental health are weak. For communities with relatively poor housing conditions (i.e., SSP in this study), the impact of housing characteristics on mental health may be more direct; for communities with relatively good housing conditions (i.e., TSW in this study), the effect of housing characteristics on mental health may be indirect. Our findings shed light on the importance of considering different contexts in developing policies related to housing and built environment and mental health.},

This essay argues that economic geographers have underestimated the power of platform and the firms that control them. We further demonstrate the remarkable concentration of these firms on the U.S. West Coast even while they organize global ecosystems. We suggest that a new spatial fix for the core of the global capitalist economy is emerging. We build upon a taxonomy of platform economy labor types and the location of the various types of labor and the implications of the ability of platforms to extract value from this labor. To illustrate, the impact on the geography of value creation, we undertake cases studies of two platforms, Amazon and Google Maps to explicate their effects upon the location of economic activity. Platforms are increasingly reorganizing labor and the location of value creation We argue that platforms are a new organizational form that is the result of an asymmetric power relationship between a platform and an ecosystem of complementers and users that interact and transact through platform. These platform leaders have the largest data sets and have created enormous teams of the best AI, machine learning researchers, and, finally, have enormous reservoirs of capital with which to capture new technologies that may threaten them.},

  abstract = {This article presents the validation process of the ReliefMaps+, an online methodological tool designed to study social inequalities collecting quantitative, qualitative and spatial data, aiming to understand the reproduction and impact of structural inequalities in daily life. Our objective is to address a gap in the literature by detailing our validation process, which aligns with qualitative, feminists and intersectional paradigms. We detail the spiral validation method we created, contrasting it with positivist approaches. This process consisted of three phases: a survey, discussion groups, and pilot tests, intersected by review meetings with the INTERMAPS team, the website development company, and the ethical and legal advisors. This iterative process incorporated the selected frameworks, with continuous revisions based on feedback from experts, participants and others in each phase, which contributed to refining the tool. The validation emphasized the concepts of positionality and reflexivity, recognizing that feedback is context-based and shaped by each person's intersectional social positions from which they produce knowledge. The findings underscore the importance of a non-linear, reflexive validation approach, highlighting the tool’s adaptability, inclusivity, and ethical considerations. The results show that ReliefMaps+ and its validation process provides a methodological framework for feminists and intersectional research, offering a model for future methodological innovations grounded in these perspectives.},

The sample comprised 365 individuals (54.8 \% female) with participants ranging from 14.08 to 88.27 years of age (M~=~43.9, SD~=~20.9). In an geographic ecological momentary assessment (GEMA), participants were prompted six times a day on at least 9 days over the course of 3 weeks, covering a total of six weekdays and three weekend days on mobile phones to report their momentary affective well-being. Urban land use categories (forest, water, urban green) were assessed with GPS-localization as environmental variables. Additionally, sunshine, rainfall, whether participants were inside or outside as well as whether they were alone or had company were included into the analyses. We used dynamic structural equation modelling to model the inter- and intraindividual differences as well as fluctuations and assess potential covariates while acknowledging the autoregressive nature of affect. The results showed that on individual level, fluctuations of momentary affective well-being were associated with sunshine, having company and travelling. No significant association emerged for urban green, forest, and water neither within individuals nor between. Methodological as well as conceptual implications are discussed and an interpretation of the present findings are provided.},

She takes on some well-established assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge and the potential of space. The way we think about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects, for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that has been persistently evaded. For Space pursues its argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement, and through telling personal and political reflection. Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how we might develop a responsibility for place beyond place.},

The analysis extends research on regional wage differentials to include differentials between men and women in two educational groups at opposite ends of the educational hierarchy. Relative wages across regional labor markets in the United States are modeled in a multilevel framework as outcomes of variation in economic conditions associated with restructuring. Using microdata from the 1990 PUMS-A 5 percent census files, as well as independent sources of macro-data on counties, I show that the direction of wage changes associated with each dimension of restructuring generally does not differ by gender or education. Wages are either higher or lower than the average labor market for all groups. However, there are significant differences in relative wages by gender and many important differences between the two educational groups in the spatial distribution of gender wage inequality. Several “spatial routes” to gender wage equality emerge that differ from the dominant temporal explanations of the declining gender wage gap and differ according to the educational background of workers.},

  abstract = {The measurement of everyday music use remains a challenge for researchers, with many of the available methodologies limited by intrusiveness or lack of ecological validity. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) addresses such limitations by assessing current subjective experience at various times throughout participants’ everyday functioning. The aim of the current project was to develop and trial a mobile ESM (m-ESM) capable of collecting event-related data during natural listening episodes. This methodology was designed to maintain a natural and familiar listening experience for participants, and to collect real-time data on personal music listening. An application (app) was created which utilized mobile-device technology, and allowed combination of experience sampling with a personal music player. Analyses were performed on trial data from 101 participants to determine the efficacy of the m-ESM. Results indicated that this methodology would maintain ecological validity and cause minimal intrusion into everyday activities of the listener. Questionnaires were answered immediately at the time of listening, minimizing the problem of retrospective recall biases. This innovative methodology allows for the collection of a wealth of listening data that will advance the accurate measurement of everyday, personal music listening.},

This contributes to a more complex and dynamic understanding of social relations and power structures, and it acknowledges the differences between categories, but it has no methodological direction. I try to take this debate a step forward, by developing what I have called Relief Maps: a new way of collecting, analysing and displaying intersectional data. I consider Relief Maps to be a sound tool for studying the Geographies of Intersectionality, as they show the relationship between three dimensions: power structures (the social), lived experience (the psychological) and places (the geographical). By showing some examples of them, I demonstrate how Relief Maps make empirical work on intersectionality possible and how they are able to take into account both privilege and oppression without using categories in a fixed and rigid way. Taking the spatial dimension as a central part of the analysis, they show how the relationship between power structures varies depending on places and also illustrate how subject formations are done and undone through everyday spaces. Relief Maps aim to take the potentialities of intersectionality and minimise its limitations: they intend to disrupt homogeneous categories while pointing towards the material consequences of oppression. Finally, Relief Maps also provide some insights on intersectionality itself, as they help to think about how power structures relate to each other and the role that experience and place play in these processes.},

Crenshaw referred to Black women’s experiences of oppression as the phenomenon to be studied and the reason why new theoretical tools, such as intersectionality, were needed. Here I approach intersectionality and lived experience from an emotional and geographic perspective, focusing on how spatiality is lived and constructed through emotions and on their role in (re)producing intersectional dynamics. I rely on Ahmed’s (Feminist Theory, Vol. 8 [2007], 149–68) conceptualization of (dis)comforts and the inhabitability of places by different bodies to show the genuinely spatial character of emotions. Applying the conceptualization to an intersectional framework, I develop a differentiation of (dis)comforts in relation to geometries of power and argue that emotions and their spatialities can be used as pointers to intersectional inequalities. I illustrate the theoretical proposals through the Relief Maps as a tool for the collection, analysis, and visualization of the social, geographic, and emotional dimensions of intersectional inequalities and reflect on how feminist research methods could consider emotions for studying intersectional dynamics.},

The empirical analysis of data collected in Hong Kong is used to elaborate and support two main claims. The first is that geography matters to not only overall well-being but also momentary well-being and that researchers should be careful to specify the influence of geographical context correctly. We therefore employ an approach that is informed by various strands of time–geographical thought and find that life satisfaction is associated more strongly with geographical context than is momentary well-being. Second, we confirm positive relations between social contacts and experienced well-being but extend earlier research by showing that these relations stretch across multiple timescales and depend to some extent on the duration of an activity episode and with whom the activity episode is undertaken. This means that the use of simple indicators of social capital is inadequate for making the complex linkages between well-being and people's social contacts understandable in empirical research.},

To contribute to this debate, we assess the conceptualizations of intersectionality embedded in the most common approach to quantitative analysis, multiple regression. We identify three features of intersectional analysis highlighted in the feminist literature: (1) attention to context; (2) a heuristic approach to identifying relevant dimensions of inequality; (3) and addressing the complex, multidimensional structuring of inequality. Using these criteria, we evaluate: (1) multiple regression including context as a higher-order interaction; (2) multiple regressions run within different contexts and compared; and (3) multilevel regression including context as a higher-order level of analysis. We demonstrate with research illustrations that the models do a progressively better job at satisfying the criteria. We conclude that the third model offers a conceptualization of intersectionality that is the most consistent with the feminist literature.},

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

This study examines recall bias in the relationship between mobility-based greenery and people’s short-term happiness across activity contexts, including homes, workplaces, recreational activity sites, and travel routes. It compares Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA) with the DRM. GEMA is a method that integrates Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) with Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The results indicate that people’s short-term happiness and mobility-based greenery exposure were underestimated as measured via the DRM’s recall data, particularly for outdoor recreational activity sites and travel routes. The GEMA effectively mitigates the recall bias issues inherent in the DRM.},

First we discuss privacy requirements grounded in both historic and contemporary perspectives on privacy. We use a three-layer model of user privacy concerns to relate them to system operations (data transfer, storage and processing) and examine their effects on user behavior. In the second part of the paper we develop guidelines for building privacy-friendly systems. We distinguish two approaches: "privacy-by-policy" and "privacy-by-architecture." The privacy-by-policy approach focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices (FIPs), while the privacy-by-architecture approach minimizes the collection of identifiable personal data and emphasizes anonymization and client-side data storage and processing. We discuss both approaches with a view to their technical overlaps and boundaries as well as to economic feasibility. The paper aims to introduce engineers and computer scientists to the privacy research domain and provide concrete guidance on how to design privacy-friendly systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing international interest in the concept of mental well-being and its contribution to all aspects of human life. Demand for instruments to monitor mental well-being at a population level and evaluate mental health promotion initiatives is growing. This article describes the development and validation of a new scale, comprised only of positively worded items relating to different aspects of positive mental health: the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). METHODS: WEMWBS was developed by an expert panel drawing on current academic literature, qualitative research with focus groups, and psychometric testing of an existing scale. It was validated on a student and representative population sample. Content validity was assessed by reviewing the frequency of complete responses and the distribution of responses to each item. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the scale measured a single construct. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Criterion validity was explored in terms of correlations between WEMWBS and other scales and by testing whether the scale discriminated between population groups in line with pre-specified hypotheses. Test-retest reliability was assessed at one week using intra-class correlation coefficients. Susceptibility to bias was measured using the Balanced Inventory of Desired Responding. RESULTS: WEMWBS showed good content validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the single factor hypothesis. A Cronbach's alpha score of 0.89 (student sample) and 0.91 (population sample) suggests some item redundancy in the scale. WEMWBS showed high correlations with other mental health and well-being scales and lower correlations with scales measuring overall health. Its distribution was near normal and the scale did not show ceiling effects in a population sample. It discriminated between population groups in a way that is largely consistent with the results of other population surveys. Test-retest reliability at one week was high (0.83). Social desirability bias was lower or similar to that of other comparable scales. CONCLUSION: WEMWBS is a measure of mental well-being focusing entirely on positive aspects of mental health. As a short and psychometrically robust scale, with no ceiling effects in a population sample, it offers promise as a tool for monitoring mental well-being at a population level. Whilst WEMWBS should appeal to those evaluating mental health promotion initiatives, it is important that the scale's sensitivity to change is established before it is recommended in this context.},

Since its first publication in 1998, the WHO-5 has been translated into more than 30 languages and has been used in research studies all over the world. We now provide a systematic review of the literature on the WHO-5. Methods: We conducted a systematic search for literature on the WHO-5 in PubMed and PsycINFO in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. In our review of the identified articles, we focused particularly on the following aspects: (1) the clinimetric validity of the WHO-5; (2) the responsiveness/sensitivity of the WHO-5 in controlled clinical trials; (3) the potential of the WHO-5 as a screening tool for depression, and (4) the applicability of the WHO-5 across study fields. Results: A total of 213 articles met the predefined criteria for inclusion in the review. The review demonstrated that the WHO-5 has high clinimetric validity, can be used as an outcome measure balancing the wanted and unwanted effects of treatments, is a sensitive and specific screening tool for depression and its applicability across study fields is very high. Conclusions: The WHO-5 is a short questionnaire consisting of 5 simple and non-invasive questions, which tap into the subjective well-being of the respondents. The scale has adequate validity both as a screening tool for depression and as an outcome measure in clinical trials and has been applied successfully across a wide range of study fields.},

Although research within the field of feminist geography has explored particular interconnections such as those between gender and race, the theoretical concept of intersectionality as debated in the wider social sciences has not been addressed. This article attempts to respond to that omission. It begins by tracing the emergence of debates about the interconnections between gender and other identities. It goes on to reflect on attempts to map geometries of oppressions. The emphasis then moves from theorizing intersectionality to questioning how it can be researched in practice by presenting a case study to illustrate intersectionality as lived experience. The conclusion demonstrates the contribution that feminist geography can make to advance the theorization of intersectionality through its appreciation of the significance of space in processes of subject formation. It calls for feminist geography to pay more attention to questions of power and social inequalities.},

  abstract = {Platform-based services are rapidly transforming urban work, lives and spaces around the world. The rise of platforms dependent on largely expendable labour relations, with significant migrant involvement, must be seen as connected, and as replicating larger social processes rather than merely technological changes. This perspective paper urgently calls for an intersectional perspective to better understand social-technical relations crossing the digital-urban interface of platform urbanism in contemporary European cities. Critics of platforms and gig work, to date, have mainly focused on algorithms-based social control, degraded working conditions, problematic employment relations and precariousness of gig work. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has~both disrupted and amplified these issues, intensifying the vulnerability of gig workers. For example, in Sweden, migrant groups and gig workers were separately identified as being hardest hit by Covid, but with little attention to the interconnectivity between these categories, nor to how these groups are co-positioned vis-a-vis larger socio-economic inequalities. Thus, we argue for a deeper understanding of the social processes underlying platforms and for active investigation of how inequalities are being produced and/or maintained in/by these processes. Urban planners, designers and policy makers will need to actively address the hybrid (digital and physical) urban spaces produced in platform urbanism in order to prevent spatial and economic inequalities. We argue for a stronger recognition of interrelated and overlapping social categories such as gender and migrant status as central to the construction of mutually constitutive systems of oppression and discrimination produced in and through the platform urbanism.},

From social media to artificial intelligence, our world is now governed by algorithms, powerful tools that not only predict human behaviour but affect how we look at each other, and ourselves. At the same time, we are seeing hard-fought-for women's rights being recontested and women feeling increasingly threatened. In America, Roe v Wade has been overturned, while in Australia, the number of sexual assaults reported to police has increased year on year for the past decade. Could it be that the digital revolution is killing feminism? Time to Reboot explores the new digital gender divide. It shows how the algorithms favoured by Big Tech, designed to respond to and reinforce group characteristics, are dramatically recasting our relationships and our personal values. AI trained on biased data is generating a new wave of male privilege, sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant. In the 2020s, the 'virtual rape' of female players in online gaming is rarely commented on, while feminist values are in record decline among a younger generation swayed by an online ethos that promotes tech libertarianism and rewards the obsessive cultivation of self-image. This book unpacks the uncomfortable parallels between a digital and tech consumer culture we find impossible to resist and the nascent decline of gender equity. It questions whether the technology that is meant to both guide us today and show us the future is, in fact, pushing women backwards - and if so, how we can fix this.},

Many digital health studies adopt an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology, which can be extended by incorporating the collection of participant location data via embedded technology within smartphones. However, there is currently a lack of customizable, geographically appropriate software for researchers to implement geographically explicit EMA (GEMA). To address this gap, we developed the Healthy Environments and Active Living for Translational Health (HEALTH) Platform. The HEALTH Platform is a customizable smartphone application that enables researchers to deliver GEMA prompts on a smartphone in real-time based on spatially complex geofence boundaries, collect audiovisual data, and flexibly adjust system logic without the need for time-consuming updates to the application on a participant’s device. We illustrate the HEALTH Platform’s capabilities through a study of park exposure and well-being. This study demonstrates the HEALTH Platform’s improvements upon existing GEMA software platforms. We observed survey prompt adherence is associated with participant motivation and the complexity of the survey instrument itself, following past EMA research findings. Overall, we find that the HEALTH Platform is a flexible mobile phone application for implementing the GEMA methodology in digital health research and practice and can be used to meet critical quality standards in this rapidly evolving field.},
