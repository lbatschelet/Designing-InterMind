  abstract = {Social Text 22.2 (2004) 117-139 , How do emotions work to align some subjects with some others and against other others? How do emotions move between bodies? In this essay, I argue that emotions play a crucial role in the "surfacing" of individual and collective bodies through the way in which emotions circulate between bodies and signs. Such an argument clearly challenges any assumption that emotions are a private matter, that they simply belong to individuals, or even that they come from within and then move outward toward others. It suggests that emotions are not simply "within" or "without" but that they create the very effect of the surfaces or boundaries of bodies and worlds., For instance, in the above narrative on the Aryan Nations Web site, the role of emotions, in particular of hate and love, is crucial to the delineation of the bodies of individual subjects and the body of the nation. Here a subject (the white nationalist, the average white man, the white housewife, the white working man, the white citizen, and the white Christian farmer) is presented as endangered by imagined others whose proximity threatens not only to take something away from the subject (jobs, security, wealth), but to take the place of the subject. In other words, the presence of these others is imagined as a threat to the object of love. The narrative involves a rewriting of history, in which the labor of others [End Page 117] (migrants, slaves) is concealed in a fantasy that it is the white subject who "built this land."2 The white subjects claim the place of hosts ("our shores") at the same time as they claim the position of the victim, as the ones who are damaged by an "unmerciful government." The narrative hence suggests that it is love for the nation that makes the white Aryans hate those whom they recognize as strangers, as the ones who are taking away the nation and the role of the Aryans in its history, as well as their future., We might note as well that the reading of others as hateful aligns the imagined subject with rights and the imagined nation with ground. This alignment is affected by the representation of both the rights of the subject and the grounds of the nation as already under threat. It is the emotional reading of hate that works to bind the imagined white subject and nation together. The average white man feels "fear and loathing"; the white housewife, "repulsion and anger"; the white workingman, "curses"; the white Christian farmer, "rage." The passion of these negative attachments to others is redefined simultaneously as a positive attachment to the imagined subjects brought together through the repetition of the signifier, "white." It is the love of white, or those recognizable as white, that supposedly explains this shared "communal" visceral response of hate. Together we hate, and this hate is what makes...},

Whiteness could be described as an ongoing and unfinished history, which orientates bodies in specific directions, affecting how they `take up' space, and what they `can do'. The paper considers how whiteness functions as a habit, even a bad habit, which becomes a background to social action. The paper draws on experiences of inhabiting a white world as a non-white body, and explores how whiteness becomes worldly through the noticeability of the arrival of some bodies more than others. A phenomenology of whiteness helps us to notice institutional habits; it brings what is behind to the surface in a certain way.},

  abstract = {In this paper I reflect on the concept of affective atmospheres in the context of the distinction between affect and emotion that has emerged in recent work on emotion, space and society. The concept of atmosphere is interesting because it holds a series of opposites -- presence and absence, materiality and ideality, definite and indefinite, singularity and generality -- in a relation of tension. To develop this account of atmosphere I juxtapose Marx's materialist imagination with a phenomenology attentive to singular affective qualities. By invoking a material imagination based on the movement and lightness of air, we learn from the former about the turbulence of atmospheres and their indeterminate quality. From the latter, we learn that atmospheres are singular affective qualities that emanate from but exceed the assembling of bodies. As such, to attend to affective atmospheres is to learn to be affected by the ambiguities of affect/emotion, by that which is determinate and indeterminate, present and absent, singular and vague.},

Others tend to equate it with the notion of identity, citizenship, or both. By relying on a critical reading of an extensive literature across academic disciplines, this study aims to offer an analytical framework for the study of belonging. I argue that belonging should be analyzed both as a personal, intimate, feeling of being ‘at home’ in a place (place-belongingness) and as a discursive resource that constructs, claims, justifies, or resists forms of socio-spatial inclusion/exclusion (politics of belonging). The risk of focusing only on one of these two dimensions is to fall in the trap of either a socially de-contextualized individualism or an all-encompassing social(izing) discourse. The open question is whether the increasing cultural and ethnic diversification of contemporary societies can lead to the formation of communities of belonging beyond communities of identity.},

The paper argues that a ‘hyper-individualised and thwarted self’ and ‘supermarket model’ of social resources for individual wellbeing underpins the contemporary dominant understanding of subjective wellbeing. This approach neglects wider spatial and temporal considerations such as inequality, inter-generationality and sustainability, and the rise of wellbeing as a technology of soft capitalism. The paper discusses the potential for relational approaches from the social sciences to provide a more ‘wholesome tonic’ to current understandings of subjective wellbeing that might rehabilitate its capability to do helpful rather than harmful work and argues for an ethical obligation to sustain critical engagement.},

  abstract = {Socioeconomic, ethnic and gender disparities in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) risk are well established but no studies have applied multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) within an intersectional framework to study this outcome. We study individuals at the first level of analysis and combinations of multiple social and demographic categorizations (i.e., intersectional strata) at the second level of analysis. Here we used MAIHDA to assess to what extent individual differences in the propensity of developing COPD are at the intersectional strata level. We also used MAIHDA to determine the degree of similarity in COPD incidence of individuals in the same intersectional stratum. This leads to an improved understanding of risk heterogeneity and of the social dynamics driving socioeconomic and demographic disparities in COPD incidence. Using data from 2,445,501 residents in Sweden aged 45–65, we constructed 96 intersectional strata combining categories of age, gender, income, education, civil- and migration status. The incidences of COPD ranged from 0.02\% for young, native males with high income and high education who cohabited to 0.98\% for older native females with low income and low education who lived alone. We calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) that informs on the discriminatory accuracy of the categorizations. In a model that conflated additive and interaction effects, the ICC was good (20.0\%). In contrast, in a model that measured only interaction effects, the ICC was poor (1.1\%) suggesting that most of the observed differences in COPD incidence across strata are due to the main effects of the categories used to construct the intersectional matrix while only a minor share of the differences are attributable to intersectional interactions. We found conclusive interaction effects. The intersectional MAIHDA approach offers improved information to guide public health policies in COPD prevention, and such policies should adopt an intersectional perspective.},

  abstract = {This article shows how activists in the open data movement re-articulate notions of democracy, participation, and journalism by applying practices and values from open source culture to the creation and use of data. Focusing on the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics. Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors outside big government and big business.},

  note = {Baack analysiert, wie das Open-Data-Movement zentrale Vorstellungen von Demokratie, Partizipation und Journalismus neu definiert. Er argumentiert, dass die Bewegung zwar den Anspruch hat, Empowerment und Transparenz durch offene Daten zu fördern, dabei aber technokratische und elitäre Logiken reproduziert.
\par
\textbf{Hauptargumente:}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Re-Artikulation von Demokratie:}\\
Open Data wird als Mittel präsentiert, um bürgerliche Partizipation zu stärken. Doch anstelle einer substantiellen Demokratisierung betont die Bewegung oft ein datenbasiertes Verständnis von Rationalität und Evidenz, das demokratische Prozesse auf technisches Wissen und quantitative Logik reduziert.
\item \textbf{Technologischer Determinismus:}\\
Viele Diskurse im Open-Data-Kontext unterstellen, dass Transparenz und Empowerment automatisch aus Offenheit folgen. Baack kritisiert diese Vorstellung als deterministisch und zeigt auf, dass technisches Wissen und Zugang zu Infrastruktur ungleich verteilt sind.
\item \textbf{Wandel journalistischer Praktiken:}\\
Der Autor beschreibt, wie datenjournalistische Projekte zwar neue Formen investigativer Recherche ermöglichen, gleichzeitig aber hohe technische Einstiegshürden erzeugen, die nicht alle Akteur:innen überwinden können. Dies führt zu neuen Machtasymmetrien innerhalb des Journalismus.
\item \textbf{Partizipation und Expertise:}\\
Die Bewegung fördert ein Modell von Partizipation, das auf technischer Kompetenz basiert. Dies bevorzugt privilegierte Gruppen, insbesondere solche mit technischem oder wissenschaftlichem Hintergrund, und schliesst marginalisierte Stimmen strukturell aus.

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Fazit:}\\
Obwohl die Open-Data-Bewegung emanzipatorische Ziele verfolgt, bleibt sie häufig in einem neoliberalen Technikverständnis gefangen. Baack ruft dazu auf, das Versprechen digitaler Partizipation kritisch zu reflektieren und stärker auf soziale Gerechtigkeit, Inklusion und machtkritische Perspektiven zu fokussieren.},

In Germany, feminists contributed  to \#YesAllWomen with posts about sexual discrimination and violence that also included the  hashtag \#Aufschrei (outcry), creating a transnational digital connection between two locally  grounded protest actions, with reference to the Twitter campaign documenting women’s  experiences of everyday sexism in Germany that created widespread public resonance in  2013. For example, German feminist activist Anke Domscheit-Berg (@anked) wrote in a  Twitter posting on May 25, 2014, “\#Yesallwomen-the global \#outcry … Because awareness  is the fi rst step towards social change.” 1 \#YesAllWomen and \#Aufschrei demonstrate theABSTRACT   This article investigates the renewed feminist politics that emerge  from the interface of digital platforms and activism today,  examining the role of digital media in aff ecting the particular  ways that contemporary feminist protests make meaning and  are understood transnationally, nationally, and locally. I consider  the political investments of digital feminisms in the context of  what Angela McRobbie has termed the “undoing of feminism” in  neoliberal societies, where discourses of choice, empowerment, and  individualism have made feminism seem both second nature and  unnecessary. Within this context, I describe a range of recent feminist  protest actions that are in a sense redoing feminism for a neoliberal  age. A key component of this redoing is the way recent protest actions  play out central tensions within historical and contemporary feminist  discourse; crucial here is the interrelationship between body politics  experienced locally and feminist actions whose effi  cacy relies on their  translocal and transnational articulation. My discussion focuses on  three case studies: SlutWalk Berlin, Peaches’ “Free Pussy Riot!” video,  and the Twitter campaigns \#Aufschrei and \#YesAllWomen. My  analysis ultimately calls attention to the precarity of digital feminisms,  which refl ect both the oppressive nature of neoliberalism and the  possibilities it off ers for new subjectivities and social formations.},

The tool was used to monitor 108 individuals who completed 3013 assessments over a 1-week period. Significant immediate and lagged associations with mental well-being were found for several natural features. These associations were stronger in people with higher trait impulsivity, a psychological measure of one's tendency to behave with little forethought or consideration of the consequences, which is indicative of a higher risk of developing mental-health issues. Our investigation suggests that the benefits of nature on mental well-being are time-lasting and interact with an individual's vulnerability to mental illness. These findings have potential implications from the perspectives of global mental health as well as urban planning and design.},

  abstract = {Research into geographical inequalities in health has focused almost exclusively on examining the effects of area-level deprivation and has been largely framed through a compositional-contextual lens, their inter-relationship and the influence of vertical macro-economic and political/policy drivers. However, in the broader health inequalities field, intersectionality has recently emerged as a critical theoretical and methodical approach which examines the concurrent and interacting influences on health of multiple axes of inequality (such as socio-economic status, gender, race/ethnicity and sexuality or gender-identity). Simultaneously, social geography has been explicitly using intersectionality to analyse how mutually constitutive forms of social oppression interact and interrelate with place. This paper exploits the analytical space opened up by this ‘intersectional turn’ by outlining the benefits for research into geographical inequalities in health that can be achieved by taking a more explicit approach to intersectional inequalities. It argues that: (1) geographical research into health inequalities should more explicitly and widely apply an intersectional lens; and relatedly that, in turn, (2) place needs to be considered as an aspect of intersectionality and integrated into the wider intersectional inequalities in health literature. The paper summarises the evolution of theories of place and health inequalities and outlines intersectional theory and the work to date that has been undertaken to integrate this perspective into our understanding of health inequalities. Drawing on the social geography literature into place and intersectionality, the paper explores how this perspective is being used to enhance our understanding of place effects more generally – and how place itself can be considered as an element of intersectional inequalities. Drawing these different bodies of work together, the paper concludes by considering the implications for theories of geographical inequalities in health.},

In this volume, Karen Barad, theoretical physicist and feminist theorist, elaborates her theory of agential realism. Offering an account of the world as a whole rather than as composed of separate natural and social realms, agential realism is at once a new epistemology, ontology, and ethics. The starting point for Barad's analysis is the philosophical framework of quantum physicist Niels Bohr. Barad extends and partially revises Bohr's philosophical views in light of current scholarship in physics, science studies, and the philosophy of science as well as feminist, poststructuralist, and other critical social theories. In the process, she significantly reworks understandings of space, time, matter, causality, agency, subjectivity, and objectivity.In an agential realist account, the world is made of entanglements of "social" and "natural" agencies, where the distinction between the two emerges out of specific intra-actions. Intra-activity is an inexhaustible dynamism that configures and reconfigures relations of space-time-matter. In explaining intra-activity, Barad reveals questions about how nature and culture interact and change over time to be fundamentally misguided. And she reframes understanding of the nature of scientific and political practices and their "interrelationship." Thus she pays particular attention to the responsible practice of science, and she emphasizes changes in the understanding of political practices, critically reworking Judith Butler's influential theory of performativity. Finally, Barad uses agential realism to produce a new interpretation of quantum physics, demonstrating that agential realism is more than a means of reflecting on science; it can be used to actually do science}

We published a pair of articles on methods for intercategorical intersectionality, in which we distinguished analytic from descriptive studies, identified causal mediation decomposition methods as an appropriate strategy for analytic intercategorical intersectionality, and introduced and validated a group of three new measures of major, day-to-day, and anticipated discrimination for use in intercategorical analysis (Bauer and Scheim, 2019; Scheim and Bauer, 2019). We respond to points raised in four invited commentaries on our original pair of articles—by Evans (2019); Jackson and VanderWeele (2019); Harnois and Bastos (2019); and Richman and Zucker (2019). We discuss differential constructs, which represent those that exist only for those at particular intersections, or for which meanings vary across intersections. Whereas such constructs may be studied intracategorically, in intercategorical studies they place limits on both the types of measures that may be used and the statistical analyses that can be conducted. Most quantitative intersectionality methods work has therefore focused on intracategorical measures, but intercategorical analyses. We present a preliminary agenda for continued methods development in quantitative intersectionality methods.},

  abstract = {Background Intersectionality is a theoretical framework rooted in the premise that human experience is jointly shaped by multiple social positions (e.g. race, gender), and cannot be adequately understood by considering social positions independently. Used widely in qualitative studies, its uptake in quantitative research has been more recent. Objectives To characterize quantitative research applications of intersectionality from 1989 to mid-2020, to evaluate basic integration of theoretical frameworks, and to identify innovative methods that could be applied to health research. Methods Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles indexed within Scopus, Medline, ProQuest Political Science and Public Administration, and PsycINFO. Original English-language quantitative or mixed-methods research or methods papers that explicitly applied intersectionality theoretical frameworks were included. Experimental studies on perception/stereotyping and measures development or validation studies were excluded. We extracted data related to publication, study design, quantitative methods, and application of intersectionality. Results 707 articles (671 applied studies, 25 methods-only papers, 11 methods plus application) met inclusion criteria. Articles were published in journals across a range of disciplines, most commonly psychology, sociology, and medical/life sciences; 40.8\% studied a health-related outcome. Results supported concerns among intersectionality scholars that core theoretical tenets are often lost or misinterpreted in quantitative research; about one in four applied articles (26.9\%) failed to define intersectionality, while one in six (17.5\%) included intersectional position components not reflective of social power. Quantitative methods were simplistic (most often regression with interactions, cross-classified variables, or stratification) and were often misapplied or misinterpreted. Several novel methods were identified. Conclusions Intersectionality is frequently misunderstood when bridging theory into quantitative methodology. Further work is required to (1) ensure researchers understand key features that define quantitative intersectionality analyses, (2) improve reporting practices for intersectional analyses, and (3) develop and adapt quantitative methods.},

However, it has so far not been applied to longitudinal data, despite the availability of such data, and growing recognition that intersectional social processes and determinants are not static, unchanging phenomena. Drawing on intersectionality and life-course theories, we develop a longitudinal version of the intersectional MAIHDA approach, allowing the analysis not just of intersectional inequalities in static individual differences, but also of life-course trajectories. We discuss the conceptualisation of intersectional groups in this context: how they are changeable over the life-course, appropriate treatment of generational differences, and relevance of the age-period-cohort identification problem. We illustrate the approach with a study of mental health using United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study data. The results reveal important differences in trajectories between generations and intersectional strata, and show that trajectories are partly multiplicative but mostly additive in their intersectional inequalities. This article provides an important and much needed methodological contribution, enabling rigorous quantitative, longitudinal, intersectional analyses in social epidemiology and beyond.},

This study investigates the association between visits to canals and rivers and mental wellbeing. We addressed the following questions: Are visits to canals and rivers associated with higher levels of mental wellbeing? Does this association depend on age and gender? Does this association vary between people with and without a diagnosis on mental illness? We used Urban Mind, a flexible smartphone application for examining the impact of different aspects of the built and social environment on mental wellbeing, a strong predictor of mental health. Participants were invited to complete an ecological momentary assessment three times a day for fourteen days. Each assessment included questions about their surrounding environment and mental wellbeing. A total of 7,975 assessments were completed by 299 participants including 87 with a diagnosis of mental illness. Multilevel regression models were used to analyse the data. We found positive associations between visits to canals and rivers and mental wellbeing (p {$<$} .05) when compared to being anywhere else and when compared to being in green spaces. Increases in mental wellbeing were still evident after the visit had taken place. These effects remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity and education, and were consistent in people with and without a diagnosis of mental illness. Spending time near canals and rivers is associated with better mental wellbeing. These findings have potential implications for mental health as well as urban planning and policy. Visits to canals and rivers could become part of social prescribing schemes, playing a role in preventing mental health difficulties and complementing more traditional interventions.},

  abstract = {A common feature of most European social stratification and mobility research is the practice of allocating individuals to a social class based on their labour market position. One of the most influential contemporary social class schemas is the EGP (Erikson–Goldthorpe–Portocarero) schema. As we saw in Chapter 1, ESeC is essentially an update of EGP. One obvious disadvantage with the EGP schema is that there is no commonly agreed way of operationalizing it, since at the time of its construction quite different standards of occupational classifications were used across countries (cf. Erikson and Goldthorpe 1992). The most widely used algorithm for coding EGP was developed by Ganzeboom and Treiman, who use ISCO-88 (COM) as a starting point (Ganzeboom and Treiman 1996: 204–205). Hence, ESeC and EGP not only have the same theoretical base but also, at least so far as the EGP operationalization by Ganzeboom and Treiman is concerned, both are derived through a combination of the ISCO code and similar additional information. As a result, we are led to believe that the two schemas will be quite similar. Furthermore, if ESeC is viewed as an update of EGP we might expect it to be at least somewhat better in predicting class relevant outcomes. Consequently, the overall purpose of this chapter is to contribute to the validation of the ESeC class schema by comparing it with EGP. The analyses are based on the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 2.},

This article explores the factors that influence the subjective momentary experiences of individuals in the city, while focusing on the impact of spatial variables on these experiences; 91 students living in Jerusalem, Israel, were asked to repeatedly self-report four dimensions of episodic experience, namely, sense of security, happiness, annoyance, and sense of comfort. Reports were sent in real time using a smartphone application during an eight-month period. The results, based on over 5000 experience samples, indicate that subjective momentary experiences, particularly sense of comfort and sense of security, are highly influenced by situational variables and environmental characteristics including type of activity and environment, place characteristics, and company. Surprisingly, personality variables which are considered to be a main determinant of wellbeing and general life satisfaction were found to be non-significant in the multilevel models that were implemented. This finding further supports the notion that momentary experiences greatly differ from general evaluations of subjective wellbeing.},

Acknowledging that these atmospheres have powerful effects, this paper focuses on the trajectories of particular misanthropic affective relations; and how such negative relations emerge from a complex set of forces which prime passengers to act. Yet this call to action is often met with a reticent passivity that transposes these negative affective relations, often in ways that intensify their force. In expanding the realm of that which is often taken to constitute the ‘social’, the paper concludes by considering how the demands of collective responsibility fold through contemporary understandings of community.},

  abstract = {Locations become places through personal significance and experience. While place data are not emotion data, per se, personal significance and experience are often emotional. In this paper, we explore the potential of using visual data exploration to support the qualitative analysis of place-related emotion data. To do so, we draw upon Creswell’s (2009) definition of place to define a generic data model that contains emotion data for a given location and its locale. For each data dimension in our model, we present symbolization options that can be combined to create a range of interactive visualizations, specifically supporting re-expression. We discuss the usefulness of example visualizations, created based on a data set from a pilot study on how elderly women experience their neighborhood. We find that the visualizations support four broad qualitative data analysis tasks: revising categorizations, making connections and relationships, aggregating for synthesis, and corroborating evidence by combining sense of place with locale information to support a holistic interpretation of place data. In conclusion, the paper contributes to the literature in three ways. It provides a generic data model and associated symbolization options, and uses examples to show how place-related emotion data can be visualized. Further, the example visualizations make explicit how re-expression, the combination of emotion data with locale information, and visualization of vagueness and linked data support the analysis of emotion data. Finally, we advocate for visualization-supported qualitative data analysis in interdisciplinary teams so that more suitable maps are used and so that cartographers can better understand and support qualitative data analysis.},

The first aim of the study is to validate some cross-cultural tools~–~focusing on the Quality of Life (QOL) spoke of the CPI's wheel of urban prosperity – for use in an urban residential context (Fornara et~al., 2010); specifically an abbreviated version of the Perceived Residential Environment Quality Indicators (PREQIs) and the Neighbourhood Attachment Scale (NAS), as well as items for measurement of Residential Satisfaction (RS). The instruments consist of 11 scales measuring PREQIs, one scale measuring Neighbourhood Attachment and three items about RS. The second aim is to test a model of the links among the constructs measured by these tools that deal with different features of QOL. For example, if some global PREQIs (i.e., pace of life) mediate the relationship between other, more specific PREQIs and Neighbourhood Attachment; and then if they ultimately predict RS, they may be considered as final outcome criteria. PREQIs, NAS and RS items are included in a self-report questionnaire, (translated from English into Farsi language) and then administered to 239 residents of Tabriz, Iran. Multivariate statistical analyses of the survey results extends the cross-cultural validity of the tools, as well as testing relationship models going from specific to global PREQIs, to NAS, finally predicting RS.

We conceptually integrate research on the workplace disadvantages experienced by women and people with disabilities. Drawing on a longitudinal analysis of community survey data that includes a diverse sample of people with and without physical disabilities, we explore the claim that women with disabilities are burdened by greater disadvantage in work settings compared to men with disabilities and women and men without disabilities. We find evidence that in comparison with these groups, women with disabilities on average are more psychologically affected by inequitable workplace conditions, partly because they earn less, are exposed to more workplace stress, and are less likely to experience autonomous working conditions.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT null Introduction Urban youth are experiencing increasing mental health problems due to diverse personal, social and environmental concerns. Youths’ detachment from natural environments, including green and blue spaces, may intensify such issues further. Contact with nature can benefit mental health and promote pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). Yet, only a few studies assess these relationships among the youth usually ignoring effects of living in diverse urban contexts, and everyday nature experiences. ECO-MIND will investigate whether urban youth’s dynamic greenspace exposure and their mental models about nature connectedness explain the associations between greenspace exposure, mental health and PEB in multiple urban contexts. Methods and analysis We will collect data from university students from the Global South (ie, Dhaka, Kampala) and Global North cities (ie, Utrecht). Participants aged 18–24 will be recruited through stratified random sampling. We will use geographic ecological momentary assessment to assess respondents’ everyday experiences and exposure to greenspaces. Our definition of greenspace exposure will be based on the availability, accessibility and visibility of greenspaces extracted from satellite and street view images. We will administer a baseline questionnaire to participants about mental health, nature connectedness and PEB characteristics. Further, we will ask participants to build mental models to show their perception of nature connectedness. Finally, we will fit partial least square structural equation models and multi-level models to our longitudinal geographic momentary assessment data. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Utrecht University (Geo S-23221). Informed consent must be given freely, without coercion and based on a clear understanding of the participation in the study. Findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at conferences. Furthermore, we will implement public engagement activities (eg, panel discussion) to share results among local stakeholders and policymakers and cocreate policy briefs.},

\par
Entwicklung eines \textbf{Land Use Regression (LUR) Modells} zur Darstellung der \textbf{räumlichen Variabilität der Urban Heat Island (UHI)} während \textbf{drei Hitzewellen} in der Stadt Bern. Verwendung eines \textbf{dichten Netzes günstiger Temperaturmessgeräte} und \textbf{öffentlich zugänglicher GIS-Daten}.
\par
\subsection{\textbf{Forschungsfragen}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Wie lässt sich die \textbf{nächtliche UHI-Intensität während Hitzewellen} räumlich modellieren?
\item Welche \textbf{Raumvariablen} (Landnutzung, Topografie, Vegetation) sind signifikante Einflussfaktoren?
\item Eignet sich das LUR-Modell zur \textbf{Planung hitzereduzierender Maßnahmen} in Städten mit komplexer Topografie?

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Kontext}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Hitzewellen sind die \textbf{tödlichsten Extremereignisse in Europa}.
\item Städte sind besonders betroffen → \textbf{UHI-Effekt} (nächtliche Wärmeakkumulation).
\item In Bern stiegen seit 2003 hitzebedingte Todesfälle messbar an.
\item 
\par
Bestehende Studien:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item zu grob (wenige Stationen),
\item teuer (offizielle Stationen),
\item oft nur interpoliert, ohne Berücksichtigung lokaler Faktoren.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\par
→ Aber: \textbf{Über-/Unterschätzung in Ost/West-Bern} → mögliche fehlende Variable (z.\,B. lokale Windsysteme)
\par
\subsection{\textbf{Diskussion}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Relevanz des Modells}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Berner LUR-Modell vergleichbar mit internationalen Studien (z.\,B. Shi et al. 2018).
\item \textbf{Neuartige Kombination}: günstige Messnetzwerke + öffentlich verfügbare GIS-Daten.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Besondere Erkenntnisse}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Kühlwirkung von Wasserflächen} (OS\_WA) \textbf{signifikant}, in früheren Studien oft ignoriert.
\item \textbf{Kaltluftflüsse} (FLAC) als \textbf{wichtiger Faktor in komplexem Terrain}, bisher kaum genutzt.
\item \textbf{Waldflächen} können nachts auch \textbf{wärmen} → evtl. Blockade von Abkühlung durch dichte Baumkronen.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Limitationen}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Topografie \& lokale Windregime nicht vollständig abgebildet.
\item Gebäude nicht in FLAC integriert → zeigt Potenzial statt effektive Flüsse.
\item Fokus auf Hitzewellen: keine Aussage zu typischen Sommernächten.
\item \textbf{Messungen ohne Feuchte} → keine Aussagen zu Hitzestress.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Fazit}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{LUR ist geeignet}, um räumliche UHI-Muster in Städten wie Bern hochaufgelöst zu modellieren.
\item Kombiniert mit kostengünstiger Messtechnik ist es \textbf{praxisnah für Stadtplanung \& Hitzevorsorge}.
\item Wasserflächen, Bäume, Vegetation \& Topografie sind \textbf{entscheidende Planungsgrößen}.

  abstract = {The temptation is to hold down and dissect these phenomena to study them – but  this would destroy them. In this book we address some problems and opportunities of doing research which respond to these challenges by trying to move with,  and to be moved by, the fleeting, distributed, multiple, non-causal, sensory, emotional and kinaesthetic. It is especially through engaging with what we and  others term the mobilities turn that purchase can be gained on these important  aspects of the social world.  The book seeks to enable and to reinforce new forms of social science  inquiry, explanation and engagement. It not only remedies the academic neglect  of various movements, of people, objects, information and ideas. It also gathers  new empirical sensitivities, analytical orientations and methods to examinesocial phenomena that are especially important in the contemporary world with  many living ‘mobile lives’ or at least being affected by the mobile lives of others  (Elliott and Urry 2010). This chapter reviews various ‘mobile methods’ for   studying (im)mobilities which the authors of the subsequent chapters design,  develop and deploy. We discuss some of the new entities that these methods  come to enact and explore important implications for the relationships between  the empirical world, theory, critique and engagement. But we end with a cautionary tale: that the development here of productive methods has an urgency in  that there are other social forces also developing powerful mobile computerbased methods and these may win out in part because of their interconnections  with forms and forces of monitoring and surveillance.  Through investigations of movement, blocked movement, potential movement and immobility, dwelling and place-making, social scientists are showing  how various kinds of ‘moves’ make social and material realities. Attention to the  fluid, fleeting, yet powerful performativity of various everyday (im)mobilities  transforms conceptions of social science inquiry, explanation and critique. We  take it that there is no research and no social science without theory, but at the  same time we argue that the mobilities turn folds analysis into the empirical in  ways that open up different ways of understanding the relationship between  theory, observation and engagement. It engenders new kinds of researchable  entities, a new or rediscovered realm of the empirical and new avenues for  critique.  Especially significant in the development of this new paradigm were the  varied writings of Simmel developed in the heyday of the railway journey and  the letter and postcard (see Gillen and Hall, in Chapter 2 of this volume, on the  huge growth in postal services in late-nineteenth-century Britain). Simmel, especially, analyses the fragmentation and diversity of modern life and shows how  motion, the diversity of stimuli and the visual appropriation of place are centrally important features of new modern urban experience. Moreover, because of  the effect of money, with its colourlessness and indifference, and its twin, the  modern city, a new precision becomes necessary in social life. Agreements and  arrangements need to demonstrate unambiguousness in timing and location. Life  in the mobile onrushing city presupposes punctuality and this is reflected in the  ‘universal diffusion of pocket watches’ (Simmel 1997: 177). The watch a  century ago was as symbolic of the ‘modern’ as the ubiquitous mobile phone is  today (see some contemporary uses of mobile phones in Chapters 8-11 below).  Simmel argues that the ‘relationships and affairs of the typical metropolitan  usually are so varied and complex that without the strictest punctuality in promises and services the whole structure would break down into an inextricable  chaos’ (Simmel 1997: 177; Urry 2007: ch. 2).  Some of Simmel’s ideas were developed within the Chicago School which in  the first half of the twentieth century provided a range of post-Simmelian mobility studies especially concerned with the itinerant (mobile) lives of hoboes,  gangs, prostitutes and migrants, with what would now be characterised as the  ‘underclass’ (see, for example, Park 1970). However, this development was cutshort in its tracks as many structural or static theories took over, including structural functionalism, positivist analysis of ‘variables’, structural Marxism and so  on. Meanwhile, the study of mobilities was turned into the professional examination of ‘transport’ and to a lesser extent of ‘tourism’, which were taken to be  specific domains to be researched far away from the provocative promptings of  Simmel’s essays on metropolitan life.  But over the past decade or so, influential new initiatives such as those examined in this book have begun to reappropriate Simmel’s work, directly or more  indirectly. This has developed through research within various domains, symbolic interactionism, cultural studies, science and technology studies, ethnomethodology, material culture, cultural geography, (participatory) design and others,  as reflected in various books and journals, including Mobilities. This work is  developing what may become a distinct mobilities paradigm. We delineate some  of the premises, promises and risks of these developments. But we do not try to  reconcile the conflicts between the theoretical orientations we see contributing to  such a paradigm. Some differences are irreconcilable and there are incompatibilities that challenge as well as shape mobilities research. Nevertheless, there is a  powerful transformative and ‘therapeutic’ potential for social science in the  interferences generated where these studies meet and gather emergent empirical  sensitivities, analytical orientations, methods and instruments to examine crucial  social and material phenomena.  This analysis of mobilities and especially of multiple and intersecting mobility systems, where each is in an adaptive and evolving relationship with each  other, is an example of ‘post-human’ analysis (Hayles 1999). However, arguing  that there is a substantive shift from the human to the post-human presupposes  that there was a previous era where the world was ‘human’ and principally constituted through disembodied and dematerialised cognition. This Enlightenment  view presumes what Ingold terms a primacy of head over heels, mind over body,  humans separate from and productive of society and culture, and a neglect of the  mobile practices of walking (2004). A mobilities turn is part of the critique of  such a humanism that posits a disembodied cogito and especially human subjects  able to think and act independently of their material worlds (Latour 1993). This  book is based around the claim that the powers of ‘humans’ are co-constituted  with/by various material agencies of clothing, tools, objects, paths, footwear,  buildings, machines, paper and so on. And thus we have never been simply  ‘human’, nor simply ‘social’.  Following Marx we might indeed claim that there are not only the relations of  life but also the forces of life, encountering, clashing with, realising, enlisting or  suppressing the creative power of the material world. Life and matter come to  matter and are made meaningful as people, objects, information and ideas move  and are (im)mobilised (see Barad 2007). People, objects, information and ideas  may be:• held in place (prisoner, clamped car, poster, rhetoric figure); • fixed in place (agoraphobic, building, a sense of place);• temporarily stationary (visitor, car in garage, graffiti, a presentation); • portable (baby, laptop, souvenir); • part of a mobile body (foetus, iPod, ID card, designer label); • prosthetic (disability assistant, contact lenses, name badge, gender); • constitutive of a mobility system (Highway Code, timetable, speed); • consisting of code (cyborg, BlackBerry, digital document, computer virus).},

Global flows of people, goods, food, money, information, services and media images are forming an intensely mobile background to everyday life. Social scientists, too, are on the move, seeking new analytical purchase on these important aspects of the social world by trying to move with, and to be moved by, the fleeting, distributed, multiple, non-causal, sensory, emotional and kinaesthetic.  Mobile Methods addresses the challenges and opportunities of researching mobile phenomena. Drawing on extensive interdisciplinary discussion, the book brings together a collection of cutting-edge methodological innovations and original research reports to examine some important implications of the mobilities turn for the processes of ‘research’, and the realm of the empirical. Through analysis that addresses questions such as ‘how are social relationships and social institutions made in and through mobility?’, and ‘how do people experience mobility in~twenty-first century world cities?', the authors mobilize sociological analysis, bringing new insights and opening up new opportunities for engagement with contemporary challenges.

While research has demonstrated a positive association between one’s environment and LWB, limited studies have explored the association between environmental characteristics and MWB. We applied the experience sampling method (ESM) to collect data on location, perceived environmental characteristics, MWB, and LWB of adult participants living in Kashiwa-no-ha area, Kashiwa City, Japan. Structural equation modeling was used to calculate the correlation coefficients between different environments and both MWB and LWB. LWB was positively associated with MWB (standardized coefficient=0.24) and urban elements—cafés/restaurants/bars (0.11), cultural/sports/education facilities (0.04), and public spaces (0.11). Meanwhile, relaxing/clean (0.56) and natural environments (0.14) were associated with higher MWB. Conversely, vibrant environments (−0.14) and being on the move (−0.11) were linked to lower MWB. LWB was positively associated with being at cultural/sports/educational facilities (0.06), and vibrant (0.15) and communicative (0.13) urban settings. MWB was associated with various built environments, emphasizing the need for places like parks and cafés that promote a positive mood, and well-designed transportation and roads. These elements are important for developing urban areas that meet the physical requirements of residents while supporting their emotional and psychological well-being.},

  abstract = {The term “safe space” dates to the late twentieth century women's movement, but it has since been used in many different contexts. In this paper, we review and analyze historical and contemporary “safe spaces”. These include “separatist” safe spaces in women's, anti-racist, and feminist communities, “inclusive” safe space classrooms, and safe spaces in which (non-human) objects are central. We argue that safe spaces should be understood not through static and acontextual notions of “safe” or “unsafe”, but rather through the relational work of cultivating them. Such an understanding reveals several tendencies. Namely, safe spaces are inherently paradoxical. Cultivating them includes foregrounding social differences and binaries (safe–unsafe, inclusive–exclusive) as well as recognizing the porosity of such binaries. Renegotiating these binaries is necessarily incomplete; a safe space is never completely safe. Even so, we encourage the critical cultivation of safe space as a site for negotiating difference and challenging oppression.},

  abstract = {Interest in the study of psychological health and well-being has increased significantly in recent decades. A variety of conceptualizations of psychological health have been proposed including hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, quality-of-life, and wellness approaches. Although instruments for measuring constructs associated with each of these approaches have been developed, there has been no comprehensive review of well-being measures. The present literature review was undertaken to identify self-report instruments measuring well-being or closely related constructs (i.e., quality of life and wellness) and critically evaluate them with regard to their conceptual basis and psychometric properties. Through a literature search, we identified 42 instruments that varied significantly in length, psychometric properties, and their conceptualization and operationalization of well-being. Results suggest that there is considerable disagreement regarding how to properly understand and measure well-being. Research and clinical implications are discussed.},

Proponents of open access question and undermine the paradigm of exclusivity central to traditional copyright law, thereby fundamentally challenging its ownership structures and the publishing practices these support. In this essay, we attempt to show what it is about the open access endeavour that resonates with a feminist theory of law and society - in other words, we consider what is “feminist” about open access.  First, we provide an overview of a relational feminist critique of traditional copyright law and the assumptions of possessive individualism that pervade it.  We then offer a brief description of the open access movement and the way in which it reflects or responds to this criticism. In doing so, we discover vital synergies between this branch of feminist legal theory and the open access movement. Ultimately, we hope to underscore the importance of an open access policy for legal journals such as this one, whose mission is to support, advance and disseminate a feminist perspective that challenges the prevailing hegemony within traditional legal scholarship. We conclude by offering ways in which this journal can help draw out the synergies between feminist criticism and the open access movement.},

  abstract = {To understand the dynamics of mental health, it is essential to develop measures for the frequency and the patterning of mental processes in every-day-life situations. The Experience-Sampling Method (ESM) is an attempt to provide a valid instrument to describe variations in self-reports of mental processes. It can be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity, and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional, cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of thought disturbance. The article reviews pratical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short-and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the technique can be usefully applied.},

  abstract = {This paper contributes to the ‘digital turn’ in geography and to conceptualizations of cognitive capitalism by focusing on how changing forms of cultural representation in the digital world constitute new forms of value extraction. It takes as a key case study the RealTech company Juwai; one of the largest transnational digital platforms connecting international estate agents and Chinese buyers. Positioning the digital platform as a site in which multiple cultural and geographic knowledges are produced and articulated as a condition for value extraction, the paper analyses a suite of textual and visual content in both English and Mandarin produced on Juwai that targets Chinese buyers and the Australian real estate industry. The core argument is that the production of cultural difference or cultural asymmetry is not simply a by-product of Juwai’s form of platform capitalism, rather mediating cultural asymmetries is a process of value extraction that is a central component of their business model. We point to a business model of ‘cultural platform capitalism’ where the technology exceeds its conventional connective and extractive functions (i.e., data as value) by translating cultural knowledge as a key business practice (i.e., cultural risk as value).},

  note = {\textbf{Dal Maso et al. (2021): Cultural Platform Capitalism – Extracting Value from Cultural Asymmetries in RealTech}
\par
In ihrem Beitrag analysieren Dal Maso et al. das Phänomen des „kulturellen Plattformkapitalismus“ am Beispiel sogenannter „RealTech“-Plattformen – Plattformen, die reale, kulturell eingebettete Räume (wie Restaurants, Kunstorte oder urbane Infrastrukturen) über digitale Interfaces monetarisieren. Im Fokus steht die Frage, wie diese Plattformen kulturelle Unterschiede – insbesondere zwischen dem Globalen Süden und Norden – nicht nur abbilden, sondern ökonomisch ausschöpfen und damit neue asymmetrische Wertschöpfungsmodelle etablieren.
\par
Die Autor:innen argumentieren, dass Plattformen wie TripAdvisor oder Airbnb nicht nur Informationen über kulturelle Orte bereitstellen, sondern aktiv an der Erzeugung von Bedeutungen, Bewertungen und ökonomischem Wert beteiligt sind. Zentral ist hierbei der Begriff der \mkbibemph{kulturellen Asymmetrie}: Plattformen nutzen bestehende Unterschiede in kulturellem Kapital, Sichtbarkeit und Bewertungspraktiken, um Profit aus bislang nicht kapitalisierten Räumen und Erfahrungen zu schlagen. Diese Prozesse erfolgen nicht neutral, sondern entlang geopolitischer Machtverhältnisse, die kulturelle Praktiken und Ausdrucksformen des Globalen Südens selektiv sichtbar, bewertbar und verwertbar machen.
\par
Besonders kritisch beleuchten Dal Maso et al. die Rolle von Nutzer:innenbewertungen und algorithmischer Sichtbarkeit. Diese Systeme der „partizipativen Bewertung“ erscheinen demokratisch, reproduzieren jedoch bestehende Ungleichheiten: Wer nicht den dominanten kulturellen Normen entspricht oder über weniger Reichweite verfügt, bleibt weniger sichtbar – und damit auch weniger monetarisierbar. In dieser Dynamik sehen die Autor:innen eine neue Form kultureller Extraktion: Wert entsteht nicht nur durch Zugang oder Nutzung, sondern durch algorithmisch verstärkte Repräsentation und Bewertung kultureller Differenz.
\par
Theoretisch verorten sie diese Prozesse im Kontext einer erweiterten marxistischen Plattformkritik. Plattformen agieren nicht nur als technische Infrastrukturen, sondern als aktive Akteure in globalen Akkumulationsregimen, die kulturelle Praktiken selektiv einhegen, standardisieren und kommerzialisieren. Die Analyse zeigt, wie Plattformen kulturelle Produktion in ein asymmetrisches Regime der Bewertung und Sichtbarkeit überführen – ein Prozess, der postkoloniale und kapitalismuskritische Fragen gleichermaßen aufwirft.},

  abstract = {Feminicide is the gender-related killing of cisgender and transgender women and girls. It reflects patriarchal and racialized systems of oppression and reveals how territories and socio-economic landscapes configure everyday gender-related violence. In recent decades, many grassroots data production initiatives have emerged with the aim of monitoring this extreme but invisibilized phenomenon. We bridge scholarship in feminist and information geographies with data feminism to examine the ways in which space, broadly defined, shapes the counterdata production strategies of feminicide data activists. Drawing on a qualitative study of 33 monitoring efforts led by civil society organizations across 15 countries, primarily in Latin America, we provide a conceptual framework for examining the spatial dimensions of data activism. We show how there are striking transnational patterns related to where feminicide goes unrecorded, resulting in geographies of missing data. In response to these omissions, activists deploy multiple spatialized strategies to make these geographies visible, to situate and contextualize each case of feminicide, to reclaim databases as spaces for memory and witnessing, and to build transnational networks of solidarity. In this sense, we argue that data activism about feminicide constitutes a space of resistance and resignification of everyday forms of gender-related violence.},

  note = {Das Paper untersucht, wie fehlende Daten – also Datenlücken, Auslassungen oder systematische Leerstellen – nicht nur technische, sondern zutiefst politische und räumliche Phänomene darstellen. Die Autor*innen plädieren für eine geographisch informierte Analyse von sogenannten „Counterdata“-Bewegungen, also Initiativen, die bewusst alternative, häufig feministische oder dekoloniale Datensätze produzieren, um dominante Infrastrukturen zu hinterfragen.
\par
\textbf{Zentrale Argumente:}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Fehlende Daten sind nicht zufällig, sondern spiegeln Machtverhältnisse wider: Bestimmte Körper, Orte oder Erfahrungen werden systematisch nicht erfasst, weil sie als irrelevant gelten oder nicht in dominante Wissenssysteme passen.
\item Diese Leerstelle ist nicht nur ein Defizit, sondern ein Ausdruck epistemischer Gewalt – besonders gegenüber marginalisierten Gruppen.
\item Die Autor*innen schlagen vor, fehlende Daten als \mkbibemph{geographies of absence} zu begreifen, also als räumlich produzierte und verortete Ausdrucksformen sozialer Ausschlüsse.
\item Counterdata-Projekte – wie etwa feministische Mapping-Initiativen, queere Datenarchive oder indigene Kartierungsprojekte – versuchen, diese Lücken bewusst zu füllen. Sie produzieren nicht nur neue Daten, sondern stellen die Grundlagen von Datenproduktion, -infrastruktur und -ethik infrage.

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Relevanz für kritische Geographie:}\\
Das Paper verbindet feministische epistemologische Perspektiven mit räumlicher Analyse und legt dar, wie alternative Datenpraktiken nicht nur methodisch, sondern auch politisch transformativ sein können. Es fordert eine Geographie der Datenlücken – nicht nur um Abwesenheiten zu identifizieren, sondern um zu zeigen, wo und wie Wissen systematisch unterdrückt oder unsichtbar gemacht wird.
\par
\textbf{Bezug zur eigenen Arbeit:}\\
Die Analyse der \mkbibemph{geographies of missing data} unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit einer bewussten, gerechteren Datenpraxis. Gerade bei der Entwicklung eigener Tools oder Befragungsinstrumente wird deutlich, dass schon die Frage, \mkbibemph{was} überhaupt erhoben wird, politisch ist. Das Paper liefert damit eine wichtige theoretische Grundlage für die Argumentation zugunsten einer feministischen, reflexiven Datenpraxis.},

However, these features are often unevenly distributed across the geographical boundaries of a city, leading to disparities in the local quality of life. This study focuses on the city of Warsaw, Poland, and uses the aforementioned characteristics and the framework of the '15-min city' concept to construct a grid-level urban Quality of Life Index (QOLI) that facilitates comparisons between the city’s districts and local neighbourhoods. The results of our study reveal a “high-inside, low-outside” pattern of quality of life, characterised by higher standards of living in the central districts and lower standards at the city's periphery.},

For those privileged enough to have nearby and safe access to natural environments, green and blue spaces have become an important enabler of everyday wellbeing. In this paper we explore the role of everyday interactions with nature for the maintenance of wellbeing, during the first and second ‘wave’ of infections in the Netherlands. Based on qualitative interviews with 30 participants in spring/summer and autumn of 2020, we detail how relationships with nature in the local surroundings and in the home qualitatively and effectively changed in response to COVID-19 induced confinement, resulting in the becoming-therapeutic of everyday micro-geographies. Amongst our participants, the conditions of semi-lockdown gave rise to increased interactions with nature, both in their outdoor surroundings and in the home. These increased interactions also led to intensified emotional and sensory experiences with nature and a greater sense of familiarity with their surroundings, which strengthened place-attachments and contributed to an increased sense of wellbeing.},

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action.

He looks at how what he calls "embodied interaction"--an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality--reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.},

Yet work in this area remains relatively sparse. This article examines parallels and divergences between feminist and health geography, which frame the context of feminist geographers doing health work. Interconnections between the two subfields where there is most exchange relate to the admission of experiential knowledge in a ‘reformed’ medical/health geography, and work engaging critical theory—particularly that of the body. The positioning of health geography in the shadow of medicine brings ambiguity to the issue of transformative politics; institutional conservatism vies with an opportunity to bring feminist work to the interstitial space of social science and critical medicine.},

\subsubsection{\textbf{Zentrale Argumente und Konzepte}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Digitale Technologien als Machtpraktiken}: Digitale Geographien müssen als politische Felder verstanden werden, in denen Macht, Kontrolle und Repräsentation ausgehandelt werden. Feministische Perspektiven helfen, diese Felder kritisch zu beleuchten.
\item \textbf{Materialität und Embodiment}: Im Gegensatz zu techno-utopischen Narrativen betonen Elwood \& Leszczynski die Körperlichkeit digitaler Praktiken. Digitale Technologien sind immer materiell eingebettet, etwa in Form von Geräten, Infrastrukturen oder Arbeitsbedingungen.
\item \textbf{Situated Knowledge und Partial Perspectives}: Aufbauend auf Donna Haraways Konzept des „situierten Wissens“ fordern die Autorinnen eine reflexive Haltung, die digitale Forschung nicht als neutral, sondern als politisch verortet begreift.
\item \textbf{Feministische Kritik an Plattformen und Datenpraktiken}: Die Autorinnen warnen vor der Reproduktion von Ungleichheiten durch datenbasierte Technologien (z.\,B. Algorithmen, Datensätze) und betonen, dass diese soziale Hierarchien nicht nur abbilden, sondern aktiv (re)produzieren.
\item \textbf{Digitale Praktiken als Orte feministischer Intervention}: Feministische digitale Geographie bedeutet nicht nur Analyse, sondern auch aktives Eingreifen. Beispiele sind partizipative Mapping-Projekte, kritische Datenvisualisierung oder Community-basierte Technologien.

\begin{itemize}

\item Elwood und Leszczynski positionieren sich gegen technikdeterministische oder unkritisch euphorische Perspektiven der digitalen Geographie.
\item Sie bauen auf feministisch-geographische Theorietraditionen (Haraway, Rose, Moss) auf, und übertragen deren zentrale Einsichten in den digitalen Raum.

  abstract = {Rationale Examining interactions between numerous interlocking social identities and the systems of oppression and privilege that shape them is central to health inequalities research. Multilevel models are an alternative and novel approach to examining health inequalities at the intersection of multiple social identities. This approach draws attention to the heterogeneity within and between intersectional social strata by partitioning the total variance across two levels. Method Utilizing a familiar empirical example from social epidemiology—body mass index among U.S. adults (N~=~32,788)—we compare the application of multilevel models to the conventional fixed effects approach to studying high-dimension interactions. Researchers are often confronted with the need to explore numerous interactions of identities and social processes. We explore the interactions of five dimensions of social identity and position—gender, race/ethnicity, income, education, and age—for a total of 384 unique intersectional social strata. Results We find that the multilevel approach provides advantages over conventional models, including scalability for higher dimensions, adjustment for sample size of social strata, model parsimony, and ease of interpretation. Conclusion Considerable variation is attributable to the within-strata level, indicating the low discriminatory accuracy of these intersectional identities and the high within-strata heterogeneity of risk that remains unexplained.

  abstract = {Intersectional multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (I-MAIHDA) is an innovative approach for investigating inequalities, including intersectional inequalities in health, disease, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and other outcomes. I-MAIHDA and related MAIHDA approaches have conceptual and methodological advantages over conventional single-level regression analysis. By enabling the study of inequalities produced by numerous interlocking systems of marginalization and oppression, and by addressing many of the limitations of studying interactions in conventional analyses, intersectional MAIHDA provides a valuable analytical tool in social epidemiology, health psychology, precision medicine and public health, environmental justice, and beyond. The approach allows for estimation of average differences between intersectional strata (stratum inequalities), in-depth exploration of interaction effects, as well as decomposition of the total individual variation (heterogeneity) in individual outcomes within and between strata. Specific advice for conducting and interpreting MAIHDA models has been scattered across a burgeoning literature. We consolidate this knowledge into an accessible conceptual and applied tutorial for studying both continuous and binary individual outcomes. We emphasize I-MAIHDA in our illustration, however this tutorial is also informative for understanding related approaches, such as multicategorical MAIHDA, which has been proposed for use in clinical research and beyond. The tutorial will support readers who wish to perform their own analyses and those interested in expanding their understanding of the approach. To demonstrate the methodology, we provide step-by-step analytical advice and present an illustrative health application using simulated data. We provide the data and syntax to replicate all our analyses.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread support from policy makers, funding agencies, and scientific journals, academic researchers rarely make their research data available to others. At the same time, data sharing in research is attributed a vast potential for scientific progress. It allows the reproducibility of study results and the reuse of old data for new research questions. Based on a systematic review of 98 scholarly papers and an empirical survey among 603 secondary data users, we develop a conceptual framework that explains the process of data sharing from the primary researcher's point of view. We show that this process can be divided into six descriptive categories: Data donor, research organization, research community, norms, data infrastructure, and data recipients . Drawing from our findings, we discuss theoretical implications regarding knowledge creation and dissemination as well as research policy measures to foster academic collaboration. We conclude that research data cannot be regarded a knowledge commons, but research policies that better incentivize data sharing are needed to improve the quality of research results and foster scientific progress.},

The social and economic fallout from COVID-19 has further exacerbated gender inequities, through increased domestic violence against women, soaring unemployment rates in women, and increased unpaid familial care taken up by women—all factors that can worsen women's health. Digital health can bolster gender equity through increased access to health care, empowerment of one's own health data, and reduced burden of unpaid care work. Yet, digital health is rarely designed from a gender equity perspective. In this Viewpoint, we show that because of lower access and exclusion from app design, gender imbalance in digital health leadership, and harmful gender stereotypes, digital health is disadvantaging women—especially women with racial or ethnic minority backgrounds. Tackling digital health's gender inequities is more crucial than ever. We explain our feminist intersectionality framework to tackle digital health's gender inequities and provide recommendations for future research.},

\par
\subsection{\textbf{Zentrale Idee}}

\par
GIS ist \textbf{nicht neutral}, sondern beruht auf bestimmten \textbf{epistemologischen und politischen Annahmen}. Der Artikel zeigt, wie \textbf{feministische, dekoloniale, queere und humanistische Perspektiven} von den Rändern der GIS-Diskurse aus zentrale \textbf{Limitierungen von GIS} kritisch aufarbeiten – und kreative Alternativen anbieten.
\par
\subsection{\textbf{Fünf zentrale Herausforderungen (core challenges of GIS)}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Place}: Komplexe Bedeutung von Ort (Platz vs. Raum)
\item \textbf{Emotions}: Repräsentation von Gefühlen
\item \textbf{Scale}: Körperliche / intime Skalen
\item \textbf{Time \& Change}: Zeitlichkeit und Wandel
\item \textbf{Relationality}: Relationale, nicht-lineare Verbindungen

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{1. Place – Ort als gelebte Erfahrung}}

\begin{itemize}

\item GIS reduziert „Ort“ auf \textbf{objektive, kartesische Koordinaten}.
\item Lived place = Beziehungen, Emotionen, Erinnerungen, Identität → \textbf{nicht quantifizierbar}.
\item „Platial Information Systems“ als Alternative: Fokus auf Bedeutung, nicht nur Geometrie.
\item \textbf{Beispiel:} „I Was There“ (Holocaust-Map) – kombiniert subjektive Erinnerungen mit visueller Kodierung (Farben, Formen).
\item Feministische \& indigene Kartografie fordert \textbf{Dekolonisierung des Raumbegriffs} → Mapping jenseits kartografischer Sprache.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{2. Emotions – Emotionale Dimensionen in Karten}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Emotionen sind zentral für \textbf{Raumerleben}, aber in GIS kaum darstellbar.
\item 
\par
Mapping als \textbf{emotionales Erkenntnisinstrument}:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Teilnahme-Methoden: Sketch Maps, Storymaps, digitale Archive.
\item Kartografische Gestaltung (Design) kann Emotionen erzeugen (Fish, 2021).

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Beispiel:} HarassMap (Ägypten) – Crowdsourcing sexueller Belästigung, Sichtbarmachung stiller Gewalt.
\item Gefordert: \textbf{Kombination narrativer, qualitativer Daten mit GIS}, um subalterne Stimmen einzubinden.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{3. Scale – Intime Räume \& Körper als Maßstab}}

\begin{itemize}

\item GIS bevorzugt \textbf{standardisierte Maßstäbe} (z.\,B. administrative Grenzen).
\item 
\par
Viele soziale Prozesse finden auf \textbf{anderen Skalen} statt:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Zuhause, Körper, Pflege, Alltag.

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Feministische Geographie} macht diese Skalen sichtbar.
\item 
\par
Zwei Zielrichtungen:
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{„Bring back the bodies“} – Kritik an entkörperlichter Objektivität (Haraway, D’Ignazio \& Klein).
\item 
\par
\textbf{Cuerpo-Territorio \& Body Mapping}:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Körper als Raum sozialer Gewalt \textbf{und} Widerstand.
\item Visuelle Methode aus dekolonial-feministischem Aktivismus (Lateinamerika).

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{4. Time \& Change – Zeitlichkeit erfassen}}

\begin{itemize}

\item GIS = tendenziell statisch. Schwierigkeit, \textbf{Veränderungen} oder \textbf{multiple Zeitlichkeiten} darzustellen.
\item Zeit ist \textbf{politisch}: z.\,B. Migration, Gentrifizierung, Kolonialismus.
\item \textbf{Narrative Karten} können Geschichten des Wandels erzählen.
\item \textbf{Beispiel:} Queering the Map – queere Erinnerungsorte aus Vergangenheit und Gegenwart → Kartierung als kollektives Gedächtnis.
\item \textbf{Million Dollar Blocks}: zeigt Kosten und Raum-Zeit-Dynamiken von Inhaftierung in US-Städten.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{5. Relationality – Beziehungen sichtbar machen}}

\begin{itemize}

\item GIS betont räumliche Nähe, aber nicht die \textbf{sozialen und politischen Verflechtungen} über Distanzen hinweg.
\item \textbf{Relationale Konzepte von Raum} (Massey): Ort als Knotenpunkt von Prozessen.
\item 
\par
Innovative Ansätze:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item „Enfolding“: Raum wird relational „gefaltet“ statt linear gemessen.
\item 
\par
\textbf{Relief Maps} (Rodó-Zárate): Orte durch Erfahrungen von Ungleichheit verbunden.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Dimensionen: Ort, Machtachsen, Emotionen.
\item Visualisierung von Komfort/Unbehagen → \textbf{topologische Repräsentation sozialer Raumbeziehungen}.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Zentrale Thesen \& Beiträge}}

\begin{itemize}

\item GIS ist \textbf{nicht objektiv}: es erzeugt Repräsentationen, die Machtverhältnisse (re)produzieren.
\item 
\par
GIS-Systeme ignorieren:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item komplexe Bedeutungen von Ort,
\item Körperlichkeit,
\item affektive Erfahrungen,
\item relationale Prozesse.

\end{itemize}

\item 
\par
Die \textbf{„Margins“ (Ränder)} sind epistemologisch und methodisch produktiv:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Queere, feministische, indigene, schwarze Perspektiven.
\item Interdisziplinär: Design, Storytelling, Digital Humanities.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Fazit}}

\begin{itemize}

\item GIS muss \textbf{neu gedacht} werden – nicht nur technisch, sondern epistemologisch.
\item Nicht einfach: „mehr Stimmen hinzufügen“, sondern: \textbf{Technologie, Praxis \& Kultur hinterfragen}.
\item 
\par
Vorschlag: \textbf{Critical GIS Praxis}:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Unsettling technologies
\item Reimagining categories (Place, Scale, Time…)
\item \textbf{Positioniertes Wissen} (Haraway) statt universeller Objektivität

\end{itemize}

\item Ziel: GIS, das \textbf{inklusiv, relational, dynamisch} und \textbf{sozial gerecht} ist.

  abstract = {Städte weisen durch ihre räumlichen Charakteristika eine erhöhte Wärmebelastung auf, was ein Risiko für die städtische Bevölkerung und Infrastruktur darstellt. Damit Städte zukünftig in Anbetracht des Klimawandels lebenswert bleiben, muss die Wärmebelastung durch eine klimaangepasste Stadtgestaltung minimiert werden. Dies ist insbesondere in öffentlichen Räumen wichtig, weil diese einen zentralen Bestandteil städtischer Lebensqualität darstellen. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht die Verknüpfung zwischen thermischem Empfinden und öffentlichen Räumen in den Quartieren Bümpliz und Breitenrain der Stadt Bern. Mittels Fragebogen und Mental Mapping wurden die Auswirkungen städtischer Strukturen, mikroklimatischer Aufwertungsmassnahmen und deren thermischen Eigenschaften auf die subjektive Wahrnehmung des öffentlichen Raumes an heissen Sommertagen analysiert. Die Ergebnisse betonen die Bedeutung von Grünräumen, Bäumen, Schatten und Wasser für das thermische Empfinden und das Wohlbefinden. Verkehrsbelastete Strassen und stark versiegelte Flächen ohne grüne Infrastruktur, die eine starke bis extreme Wärmebelastung aufweisen, werden als unangenehm empfunden. Die Bewertung der Quartiersgestaltung ergab eine mässige Zufriedenheit und Potenzial zur Verbesserung bezüglich des Angebots und der bisherigen Umsetzung mikroklimatischer Aufwertungsmassnahmen. Die Arbeit liefert wichtige Erkenntnisse darüber, wie thermische Faktoren und weitere Umweltbedingungen das Wohlbefinden in verschiedenen Quartieren beeinflussen. Diese Erkenntnisse können zur Entwicklung gezielter Massnahmen zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität in Städten beitragen. Die Arbeit betont zudem die Notwendigkeit, psychologische und soziale Aspekte des thermischen Empfindens bei städtischen Planungsprozessen zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel zu berücksichtigen.},

\item \textbf{Digitale Daten} wurden direkt übernommen, \textbf{analoge Daten manuell digitalisiert} (Nachzeichnen der Markierungen als Polygone).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Datenverarbeitungsschritte:}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Bereinigung der Eingaben (Markierungen in Linien und Kreisen → Umwandlung in Flächen).
\item Erstellung von \textbf{Dichtekarten (Heatmaps)} durch Überlagerung der Flächen → Darstellung generalisierter Mental Maps.
\item \textbf{Verknüpfung der Orte mit Attributdaten}, z.\,B. Tageszeit des Aufenthalts oder Empfindens.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Soziodemografische Differenzierungen}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Alter:} Ältere Menschen meiden andere Orte als Jüngere.
\item \textbf{Gender:} Frauen fühlen sich z.\,B. in der Fussgängerzone weniger wohl, Männer empfinden das Bienzgut häufiger als angenehm.
\item \textbf{Gartenbesitz:} Personen mit Garten geben andere Wohlfühlorte an als solche ohne.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Methodenkritik}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Stärken:} Grosse Stichprobe durch standardisierten Fragebogen, gute Vergleichbarkeit.
\item \textbf{Limitationen:} Keine Rückfragen möglich, kleine Rücklaufquote (\textasciitilde 22\,\%), Sprache nur Deutsch.

  abstract = {Place-based socio-economic and racial inequities contribute to health disparities among people with HIV (PWH). We used geographic ecological momentary assessment (GEMA) methodologies to explore the interplay between psychosocial outcomes in daily diaries and community spatial measures among PWH in New Orleans. PWH (N = 69) were recruited from a clinic-based cohort study. Micro-longitudinal data were collected via smartphone-based daily diaries and geospatial tracking over 14 days. First, correlations were run between diary derived outcomes (e.g., feeling safe in current location, stress), and spatial measures (e.g., violent crime, alcohol outlets, and vacant lots) within a half-mile buffer around each diary point to understand the real time associations between mood and space. Next, we fit multilevel models, controlling for between-person effects, to assess within-person associations between accumulative spatial daily violence exposure (50m, 100m and 200m buffers), and measures of daily mood and coping. Violent crime, alcohol outlets and vacant lots were inversely correlated with feeling safe and positively correlated with perceived ease of obtaining drugs. Vacant lots were positively associated with stress and inversely correlated with positive mood. Within individuals, higher daily accumulated violence exposure was associated with increased rumination at the 50m buffer level, decreased trust in oneself and others at the 100m buffer, and decreased ratio of positive/negative mood at all buffers. Our results emphasize the intricate interplay between mental wellness, coping mechanisms, and spatial measures in PWH. Future research and interventions for PWH should consider how spatial factors may influence PWH in terms of mental health and care engagement.},

  abstract = {“Digital sovereignty” has become a buzzword in digital policies. Contrary to the imaginary of digital transformation as preceding an era of limitless global networking in the 1990s, approaches to state regulation and delimitation of data flows as well as programmes for national digital infrastructures are justified with calls for digital sovereignty across very different contexts. This forum brings together contributions from political geography, law, computer science, and ethics that compare and analyse discourses and practices of digital sovereignty. The case studies on Russia and the EU reveal parallels as well as fundamental differences in the conception and implementation of digital sovereignty. Essays on the challenges posed by new forms of cross-border interaction (such as cloud computing) and new actors (such as digital platforms) illustrate that the traditional coupling of concepts of sovereignty, territoriality and the state, of jurisdiction and borders, must be rethought. The essays in this forum thus make it clear that the digital transformation is not simply a socio-technical modernisation process. It is rather shaped in specific ways and should be understood and analysed as (geo)-political discourses and practices. The forum contributes to the development of a political digital geography that analyses how the digital transformation is contested and produced in specific ways and unearths the politics and spatialities conceived and produced in these discourses and practices.},

Statt digitale Souveränität als statisches Konzept zu behandeln, schlägt der Artikel vor, sie aus einer kritisch-geographischen Perspektive als \textbf{„kontestierte Räumlichkeit“} zu analysieren. Die Autor:innen greifen auf Konzepte der kritischen Geographie (u.\,a. Macht, Territorialisierung, infrastrukturelle Kontrolle) zurück, um die Verflechtungen zwischen digitalen Infrastrukturen, geopolitischen Interessen und technologischer Kontrolle zu analysieren.
\par
\textbf{Zentrale Argumente:}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Digitale Souveränität wird sowohl von Staaten als auch von privaten Akteuren genutzt, um territoriale und regulatorische Kontrolle über digitale Infrastrukturen zu reklamieren.
\item Der Begriff wird in politischen Diskursen normativ aufgeladen – etwa als Schutz der Bürger:innenrechte oder als wirtschaftspolitische Absicherung gegen globale Tech-Konzerne –, ist aber praktisch oft widersprüchlich oder selektiv umgesetzt.
\item Beispiele wie Cloud-Initiativen, Internetregulierung oder Infrastrukturprojekte (z.\,B. Gaia-X, Datenzentren) verdeutlichen, dass digitale Souveränität geopolitisch, wirtschaftlich und technologisch \textbf{räumlich konkretisiert und fragmentiert} wird.
\item Der Artikel zeigt auf, dass digitale Souveränität auch \textbf{eine Form von räumlicher Re-Territorialisierung} darstellt, in der Staaten, Unternehmen und andere Akteure digitale Infrastrukturen als strategische Ressource verorten und kontrollieren wollen.

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Beitrag zur Debatte:}\\
Der Artikel leistet einen wichtigen Beitrag zur geographischen Theoriebildung, indem er die analytische Trennlinie zwischen digitaler Infrastruktur, staatlicher Steuerung und globalem Kapitalismus durch eine räumlich differenzierte Betrachtung der Souveränitätsdiskurse überwindet. Digitale Souveränität erscheint hier nicht als technisches oder juristisches Konzept, sondern als \textbf{umkämpftes politisch-räumliches Projekt}, das ständig (re)produziert und verhandelt wird.},

So far, there is no standard for applying intersectionality in quantitative social research. Therefore, this paper aims to present how intersectionality can be applied in quantitative research and to elaborate on and evaluate several methodological approaches in this regard. More precisely, we describe the tenets of three different quantitative approaches: multivariate linear models, conventional multilevel analysis, and multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MIAHDA). We compare the three approaches and outline their methodological benefits and limitations.},

Emphasizing that bodily sovereignty is integral to data sovereignty, feminist intervention has sought to tackle such violations of personhood by putting bodies back into data governance debates. This paper by Anita Gurumurthy and Nandini Chami demonstrates that such an approach may not be adequate to challenge the relations of domination encoded in data. It argues that what is needed, instead, is a shift in focus from reclaiming the materiality of embodiment to restructuring the material relations of data as a social knowledge commons. Centering a feminist relational ontology and ethics, the paper offers some concrete directions for collective social control over the health data commons. It shows how, in the final analysis, equality of autonomy in the datafied social is predicated on an expanded idea of data sovereignty – one that promotes the public commons of social knowledge, even as it strives to prevent incursions into the private space.},

  abstract = {Disabled people experience significant social discrimination and spatial exclusion in their everyday lives in the city. In recent years, discriminatory acts have increasingly been labelled as 'hate crimes'. We argue that hate crime's association with harassment and violence has obscured the more common prejudicial attitudes and actions, which create anxiety and fear. Further, the paper seeks to shift the disability hate crime discourse from its present focus on individual victimisation, to the micro and local spaces, social relations and wider socio-political contexts, within which these acts emerge. We set out a critique of hate crime discourse, offering instead a relational interpretation of people's experiences of place, drawing on aspects of non-representational theory. We argue that everyday movements through the city and encounters with others, produce senses of anxiety and precarity, as well as experiences of belonging, in the context of structural disablist attitudes. The paper draws on a collaborative research project in a city centre in Scotland, using a methodology of walking interviews and focus groups. The findings are presented in four themes, illustrated by qualitative GIS mapping: (i) recorded and experienced hate crime and harassment in the city; (ii) routes into and mobility within the city; (iii) spaces of fear and anxiety, and inclusion and welcome; and (iv) encounters and relations with others. We conclude by arguing that a relational approach, examining the dynamic unfolding or emergence of people's embodied and emotional experiences and encounters (both negative and positive), in a range of contexts, is a significant contribution to the hate crime debate.},

  abstract = {Loneliness is a major public health concern with links to social and environmental factors. Previous studies have typically investigated loneliness as a stable emotional state using retrospective cross-sectional designs. Yet people experience different levels of loneliness throughout the day depending on their surrounding environment. In the present study, we investigated the associations between loneliness and social and environmental factors (i.e. overcrowding, population density, social inclusivity and contact with nature) in real-time. Ecological momentary assessment data was collected from participants using the Urban Mind smartphone application. Data from 756 participants who completed 16,602 assessments between April 2018 and March 2020 were used in order to investigate associations between momentary feeling of loneliness, the social environment (i.e. overcrowding, social inclusivity, population density) and the built environment (i.e. contact with nature) using multilevel modelling. Increased overcrowding and population density were associated with higher levels of loneliness; in contrast, social inclusivity and contact with nature were associated with lower levels of loneliness. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education and occupation. The positive association between social inclusivity and lower levels of loneliness was more pronounced when participants were in contact with nature, indicating an interaction between the social and built environment on loneliness. The feeling of loneliness changes in relation to both social and environmental factors. Our findings have potential implications for public health strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the burden of loneliness on society. Specific measures, which would increase social inclusion and contact with nature while reducing overcrowding, should be implemented, especially in densely populated cities.},

\subsection{\textbf{Zentrale Idee}}

\par
Erstmals wird in Echtzeit und im Alltag untersucht, \textbf{wie sich die Vielfalt natürlicher Elemente (natural diversity)} auf das \textbf{momentane mentale Wohlbefinden} auswirkt – nicht nur das Vorhandensein von Natur, sondern \textbf{deren Vielfalt} wird als wichtiger Einflussfaktor betrachtet.
\par
\subsection{\textbf{Forschungsfragen \& Hypothesen}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Wirken sich spezifische Naturmerkmale (z.\,B. Bäume, Vogelgesang, Wasser) \textbf{positiv und nachhaltig} auf das Wohlbefinden aus?
\item Führt eine höhere \textbf{Vielfalt} dieser Merkmale zu \textbf{größeren mentalen Gesundheitsvorteilen}?
\item Vermittelt die \textbf{Vielfalt} den Zusammenhang zwischen Naturumgebung und Wohlbefinden?

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Kontext}}

\begin{itemize}

\item 70\,\% der Weltbevölkerung werden bis 2050 in Städten leben.
\item Stadtleben erhöht Risiko für psychische Krankheiten – ein möglicher Grund: \textbf{fehlende Naturerfahrungen}.
\item 
\par
Bisherige Forschung konzentrierte sich oft auf:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Quantität (z.\,B. Nähe zu Parks),
\item Dauer des Aufenthalts,
\item oder visuelle Reize in Laborsettings – \textbf{wenig zu Vielfalt in realen Alltagsräumen}.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Theoretische Fundierung}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Attention Restoration Theory (ART)}: Natur hilft, erschöpfte kognitive Ressourcen wiederherzustellen.
\item \textbf{Stress Recovery Theory (SRT)}: Natur reduziert physiologische Stressreaktionen.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Methodologie: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) via App}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Urban Mind App}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Kooperation: King’s College London, J\&L Gibbons, Nomad Projects.
\item \textbf{Teilnahme:} weltweit, 2018–2023, n = 1998 (Hauptsample).
\item \textbf{Dauer:} 14 Tage, 3 EMA/Tag = 42 Messzeitpunkte.
\item 
\par
Fragen zu:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item mentalem Wohlbefinden (10 Items: 5 positiv, 5 negativ),
\item sicht- oder hörbare Natur (Bäume, Pflanzen, Wasser, Vogelgesang),
\item GPS-Standort,
\item Foto + 8 Sekunden Audio (zur Beteiligung, nicht für Analyse genutzt).

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Natural Diversity Score}}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
0–4 Punkte je EMA:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 1 Punkt pro beobachteter Naturkomponente: Baum, Pflanze, Vogel, Wasser.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Ergebnisse}}

\subsubsection{1. \textbf{Unmittelbare Effekte}}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
Alle Naturmerkmale positiv assoziiert mit höherem Wohlbefinden (p {$<$} 0.001).
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Vögel}: +1.56 Punkte
\item \textbf{Pflanzen}: +1.31 Punkte
\item \textbf{Bäume}: +1.06 Punkte
\item \textbf{Wasser}: +1.60 Punkte

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2. \textbf{Zeitverzögerte Effekte}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Vögel, Pflanzen, Bäume}: auch nach ca. 8\,h signifikant positiv.
\item \textbf{Wasser}: kein signifikanter Lag-Effekt.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3. \textbf{Natural Diversity}}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
Linearer Zusammenhang: \textbf{mehr Vielfalt = mehr Wohlbefinden}.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item z.\,B. bei 50\,\%-Sample: +0.74 Punkte pro zusätzlichem Naturmerkmal.
\item Effekt bleibt auch nach 8\,h bestehen (+0.20 Punkte).

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{4. \textbf{Mediationsanalyse}}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
\textbf{23.4\,\% des Effekts} von „in Natur sein“ auf Wohlbefinden wird über Vielfalt vermittelt.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Total Effect: +3.89 Punkte
\item Direct Effect: +2.98 Punkte
\item Indirect (via diversity): +0.91 Punkte

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Stärken}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Realwelt-Daten} in Echtzeit, hohe ökologische Validität.
\item \textbf{Längsschnittdesign}: Erfassung dynamischer Tagesverläufe.
\item Große Samplegröße, differenzierte Analysen (25\,\%/50\,\%/75\,\% Completion Rates).
\item \textbf{Berücksichtigung soziodemografischer Confounder} (Alter, Geschlecht, Bildung etc.).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Limitationen}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Selbstselektion}: evtl. Bias durch naturaffine Personen.
\item \textbf{Nicht-repräsentative Stichprobe} (jung, gut gebildet, Smartphone-affin).
\item \textbf{Keine Kausalität}: beobachtendes Design.
\item \textbf{Subjektive Maße}: z.\,B. Erfassung der Naturmerkmale durch Laien (Gefahr der Überschätzung).
\item \textbf{Kein Einbezug weiterer Umweltfaktoren} (z.\,B. Lärm, Wetter, städtischer Kontext).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Diskussion \& Bedeutung}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Vielfalt} zählt: Nicht nur grün ≠ gut, sondern \textbf{bunt = besser}.
\item Effekt auch \textbf{zeitverzögert spürbar} (bis zu 8\,h).
\item 
\par
Unterstützung für \textbf{naturbasierte Interventionen}:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Urbanes Design → vielfältige, sensorisch reiche Räume.
\item Weg von Monokulturen (Rasenflächen) hin zu \textbf{polykulturellen Biodiversitätsinseln}.

\end{itemize}

\item Relevanz für \textbf{Public Health}, \textbf{Stadtplanung} \& \textbf{Umwelterziehung}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Fazit}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Diese Studie zeigt: \textbf{Mehr natürliche Vielfalt in Städten erhöht nachweislich das momentane Wohlbefinden}.
\item Vielfalt wirkt dabei nicht nur im Moment, sondern \textbf{über Stunden hinweg}.
\item Urbanes Naturdesign muss sich \textbf{nicht nur an Fläche, sondern an Diversität} orientieren.
\item App-basierte Forschung ermöglicht \textbf{partizipative, globale und skalierbare Ansätze} für zukünftige Studien.

  abstract = {In the past twenty years, intersectionality has emerged as a compelling response to arguments on behalf of identity-based politics across the discipline. It has done so by drawing attention to the simultaneous and interacting effects of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, and national origin as categories of difference. Intersectional arguments and research findings have had varying levels of impact in feminist theory, social movements, international human rights, public policy, and electoral behavior research within political science and across the disciplines of sociology, critical legal studies, and history. Yet consideration of intersectionality as a research paradigm has yet to gain a wide foothold in political science. This article closely reads research on race and gender across subfields of political science to present a coherent set of empirical research standards for intersectionality.Ange-Marie Hancock is Assistant Professor of Political Science \& African American Studies at Yale University (ange-marie.hancock@yale.edu).

More importantly for this article, the contemporary interest in affect evidences a dissatisfaction with poststructuralist approaches to power, framed as hegemonic in their negativity and insistence of social structures rather than interpersonal relationships as formative of the subject. The article focuses on the recent contributions of Brain Massumi and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in particular, unpacking their celebration of the difference that affect makes. The author's critique of the affective turn focuses on both the illusion of choice that it offers the cultural critic, and its rewriting of the recent history of cultural theory to position affect as ‘the new cutting edge’. While affect may constitute a valuable critical focus in context, it frequently emerges through a circular logic designed to persuade ‘paranoid theorists’ into a more productive frame of mind - for who would not prefer affective freedom to social determinism? Yet it remains unclear what role affect may have once this rhetoric has worked its persuasive magic. In addition, and more worryingly, affective rewriting flattens out poststructuralist inquiry by ignoring the counter-hegemonic contributions of postcolonial and feminist theorists, only thereby positioning affect as ‘the answer’ to contemporary problems of cultural theory.},

The emotions can be mobilised to serve entrenched interests or challenge power hierarchies in social life, including through digitally mediated spaces. Whether in real or digital life, emotional labour and emotion work are constitutive of temporality, sociality and spatiality.

In particular, these perspectives facilitate analyses of power imbalances and value extraction across territories—an under-theorized aspect within platform studies. We theorize this dynamic by introducing the descriptor ‘digital value network’ (DVN): a digitally mediated nexus of platform operations that produce and distribute value between territories, on the basis of labour transactions. Empirically, we draw on a multi-year action research project, assessing the operations of platforms and the experiences of platform workers in 54 countries. Our analysis highlights that platforms as lead firms extend GVC/GPN logics of coordination and drivenness in DVN to (i) optimize production capabilities while externalizing ownership and costs, (ii) accumulate both monetary and non-monetary forms of value, and (iii) concentrate power at the global scale in both existing and new sectors.},

Es fokussiert auf die Art und Weise, wie Plattformunternehmen („global digital platforms“) Wert generieren, Arbeit organisieren und geographische Ungleichheiten (re)produzieren.
\par
\subsubsection{🏗️ \textbf{Theoretischer Rahmen}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Das Paper baut auf der Literatur zu \textbf{Plattformkapitalismus}, \textbf{Wertschöpfungsketten} und \textbf{digitalen Infrastrukturen} auf.
\item Es argumentiert, dass Plattformen keine neutralen Vermittler sind, sondern aktiv die Organisation von Arbeit und Kapital in räumlich ungleichen Strukturen formen.
\item Die Autor*innen schlagen den Begriff \textbf{„Digital Value Network“} vor – als Erweiterung des klassischen Begriffs der „Global Value Chain“ (GVC) – um die neue Rolle digitaler Plattformen zu erfassen.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{🌍 \textbf{Geographische Perspektive}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Plattformen \textbf{restrukturieren Räume}, indem sie traditionelle industrielle Produktionslogiken durch digitale Vermittlungslogiken ersetzen.
\item Sie \textbf{verschieben Machtverhältnisse} weg von lokal eingebetteten Akteuren hin zu transnationalen, datengetriebenen Plattformfirmen.
\item Der Plattformkapitalismus ist \textbf{ungleich verteilt}: digitale Wertschöpfung konzentriert sich in globalen Zentren, während Arbeit zunehmend in peripheren Regionen ausgelagert wird.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{⚙️ \textbf{Mechanismen der Wertgenerierung}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Datenextraktion}: Plattformen gewinnen Wert durch die systematische Erfassung, Analyse und Monetarisierung von Nutzerdaten.
\item \textbf{Vermittlung}: Plattformen kontrollieren die Zugänge zu Märkten und Ressourcen – sie vermitteln nicht neutral, sondern nach proprietären Logiken.
\item \textbf{Digitale Infrastruktur}: Eigentum und Kontrolle über digitale Infrastrukturen (Cloud, Algorithmen, Schnittstellen) werden zu zentralen Machtressourcen.
\item \textbf{Algorithmische Steuerung von Arbeit}: Arbeitsprozesse (z.\,B. bei Uber oder Amazon MTurk) werden zunehmend automatisiert, überwacht und bewertet.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{🧱 \textbf{Beitrag des Papers}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Das Paper macht deutlich, dass \textbf{Plattformkapitalismus neue geographische Ungleichheiten produziert}, indem er bestehende Machtasymmetrien nicht nur fortführt, sondern verschärft.
\item Es fordert eine \textbf{ökonomisch-geographische Forschung}, die diese Veränderungen ernst nimmt und kritisch analysiert.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{📚 \textbf{Stil \& Relevanz}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Sehr theoretisch fundiert, aber klar argumentiert.
\item Bietet einen \textbf{kritischen Blick} auf die Rolle von Plattformen im globalen Kapitalismus – mit vielen Anknüpfungspunkten für feministische, postkoloniale oder dekoloniale Perspektiven (auch wenn diese nicht direkt im Fokus stehen).
\item Besonders relevant für Diskussionen um \textbf{digitale Souveränität}, \textbf{datenpolitische Machtasymmetrien} und die \textbf{politische Ökonomie digitaler Arbeit}.

We argue there has been an ontological and epistemological impasse in ‘alcohol studies’ between approaches that have considered the biological, physiological and psychological impacts of alcohol consumption and those focused on social and cultural practices. While there has been an artificial separation, and hence under-theorisation of the relationships between emotions, embodiment, affect and everyday uses of alcohol, we develop an argument that signals the possibilities of a more nuanced and sophisticated approach. We present empirical research from the UK and offer theoretical, methodological and policy-relevant conclusions.},

Can well-being be measured by a subjective survey, even approximately? In this paper, we discuss research on how individuals' responses to subjective well-being questions vary with their circumstances and other factors. We will argue that it is fruitful to distinguish among different conceptions of utility rather than presume to measure a single, unifying concept that motivates all human choices and registers all relevant feelings and experiences. While various measures of well-being are useful for some purposes, it is important to recognize that subjective well-being measures features of individuals' perceptions of their experiences, not their utility as economists typically conceive of it. Those perceptions are a more accurate gauge of actual feelings if they are reported closer to the time of, and in direct reference to, the actual experience. We conclude by proposing the U- index, a misery index of sorts, which measures the proportion of time that people spend in an unpleasant state, and has the virtue of not requiring a cardinal conception of individuals' feelings.},

We collected data from 221 participants from two communities in Hong Kong, i.e., Sham Shui Po (SSP) and Tin Shui Wai (TSW), using a stratified random sampling approach. Big datasets were also used to derive relevant built-environment features at the street block level. We used structural equation modeling to explore the complex relationships among housing characteristics, built-environment features, and mental health. The results indicate that the associations between built-environment quality and people’s mental health are weak. For communities with relatively poor housing conditions (i.e., SSP in this study), the impact of housing characteristics on mental health may be more direct; for communities with relatively good housing conditions (i.e., TSW in this study), the effect of housing characteristics on mental health may be indirect. Our findings shed light on the importance of considering different contexts in developing policies related to housing and built environment and mental health.},

This essay argues that economic geographers have underestimated the power of platform and the firms that control them. We further demonstrate the remarkable concentration of these firms on the U.S. West Coast even while they organize global ecosystems. We suggest that a new spatial fix for the core of the global capitalist economy is emerging. We build upon a taxonomy of platform economy labor types and the location of the various types of labor and the implications of the ability of platforms to extract value from this labor. To illustrate, the impact on the geography of value creation, we undertake cases studies of two platforms, Amazon and Google Maps to explicate their effects upon the location of economic activity. Platforms are increasingly reorganizing labor and the location of value creation We argue that platforms are a new organizational form that is the result of an asymmetric power relationship between a platform and an ecosystem of complementers and users that interact and transact through platform. These platform leaders have the largest data sets and have created enormous teams of the best AI, machine learning researchers, and, finally, have enormous reservoirs of capital with which to capture new technologies that may threaten them.},

\par
Kenney und Zysman zeigen, dass Plattformen nicht nur digitale Infrastrukturen bereitstellen, sondern aktiv neue Formen der \textbf{Wertschöpfung}, \textbf{Arbeit}, \textbf{Kontrolle} und \textbf{Räumlichkeit} erzeugen. Sie argumentieren, dass Plattformunternehmen als neue institutionelle Form verstanden werden müssen, die durch ihre Rolle als Vermittler, Infrastrukturanbieter und Marktgestalter fundamentale Veränderungen in der Ökonomie hervorrufen.
\par
\subsubsection{\textbf{Kernpunkte}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
\par
\textbf{Plattformen als neue institutionelle Form}:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Plattformen sind keine bloßen Unternehmen, sondern neue „Markt-Infrastrukturen“.
\item Sie operieren als Gatekeeper, aggregieren Daten und kontrollieren Zugang zu Märkten und Informationen.

\end{itemize}

\item 
\par
\textbf{Restrukturierung des Raumes}:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Plattformökonomien verändern die Geographie der Wertschöpfung, indem sie traditionelle physische Grenzen überschreiten.
\item Dies führt zu einer neuen \textbf{Entkopplung von Ort und wirtschaftlicher Aktivität}: Lokale Märkte und globale Netzwerke verschränken sich neu.

\end{itemize}

\item 
\par
\textbf{Kapitalistische Akkumulation}:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Plattformen extrahieren Wert nicht nur aus Produktion, sondern zunehmend durch \textbf{Kontrolle von Daten, Aufmerksamkeit und Zugang}.
\item Der Raum der Akkumulation wird dabei nicht „aufgelöst“, sondern neu zusammengesetzt: z.\,B. durch Rezentralisierung in urbanen Hubs oder neue periphere Dateninfrastrukturen.

\end{itemize}

\item 
\par
\textbf{Machtverhältnisse}:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Plattformen verschieben Machtverhältnisse zwischen Arbeit, Kapital und Konsum. Sie setzen neue Bedingungen für Arbeit und Partizipation und bestimmen zunehmend die Regeln des Zugangs zu ökonomischen Ressourcen.

\end{itemize}

\item 
\par
\textbf{Implikationen für Regulierung und Forschung}:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Der Artikel fordert eine \textbf{geographisch fundierte Kritik} an Plattformkapitalismus und eine stärkere Regulierung.
\item Er unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit, \textbf{digitale Geographien} als aktiven Teil kapitalistischer Restrukturierung zu analysieren.

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Bezug zu feministischer Geographie}}

\par
Das Paper selbst hat keinen explizit feministischen Fokus. Aber aus einer feministischen Perspektive könnten folgende Anschlussstellen besonders relevant sein:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Unsichtbarmachung von Arbeit}: Viele Tätigkeiten in Plattformökonomien (z.\,B. Care-Arbeit, Content-Moderation) sind „unsichtbar“ und schlecht bezahlt – ein klassisches Thema feministischer Ökonomie.
\item \textbf{Ungleiche Teilhabe}: Wer Zugang zu digitalen Plattformen und deren Infrastrukturen hat, ist sozial und räumlich stark ungleich verteilt – ein Punkt, den feministische Geographien häufig betonen.
\item \textbf{Daten als Machtform}: Die Kontrolle über Datenströme reproduziert bestehende Hierarchien und Ausschlüsse – zentrale Anliegen feministischer Kritik an Big Tech

What sets this technique apart from traditional ethnographic methods such as participant observation and interviewing is its potential to access some of the transcendent and reflexive aspects of lived experience in situ. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in two urban neighborhoods, I examine five themes which go-alongs are particularly suited to explore: environmental perception, spatial practices, biographies, social architecture and social realms. I argue that by exposing the complex and subtle meanings of place in everyday experience and practices, the go-along method brings greater phenomenological sensibility to ethnography.},

  abstract = {Participation in sport is viewed as a key means of improving health and wellbeing in many countries, but the processes constituting participation in community sports clubs remain poorly understood. Although studies have considered the wellbeing implications of non-competitive and individual sporting activity, further theoretical and empirical work is required to understand (both sporting and non-sporting) participation in community sports clubs. In this article we consider the contribution of approaches to social practice, situated wellbeing and affinities and atmospheres to advance our understanding. Using the example of community cricket clubs in England and Wales, we consider the potential of such approaches and the implications of disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) crisis. In conclusion, we argue that in a period characterised by political, social and economic turmoil, being able to provide detailed, place specific accounts of the important relations and practices existing in and through community sports clubs is a crucial activity for social scientists.},

Presenting the essential writings of black lesbian poet and feminist writer Audre Lorde, Sister Outsider celebrates an influential voice in twentieth-century literature. In this charged collection of fifteen essays and speeches, Lorde takes on sexism, racism, ageism, homophobia, and class, and propounds social difference as a vehicle for action and change. Her prose is incisive, unflinching, and lyrical, reflecting struggle but ultimately offering messages of hope. This commemorative edition includes a new foreword by Lorde-scholar and poet Cheryl Clarke, who celebrates the ways in which Lorde's philosophies resonate more than twenty years after they were first published. These landmark writings are, in Lorde's own words, a call to "never close our eyes to the terror, to the chaos which is Black which is creative which is female which is dark which is rejected which is messy which is...""[Lorde's] works will be important to those truly interested in growing up sensitive, intelligent, and aware."-New York Times Intro -- Other Books by This Author -- Title Page -- Copyright -- Acknowledgments -- Contents -- Foreword -- Introduction -- Notes from a Trip to Russia -- Poetry Is Not a Luxury -- The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action -- Scratching the Surface: Some Notes on Barriers to Women and Loving -- Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power -- Sexism: An American Disease in Blackface -- An Open Letter to Mary Daly -- Man Child: A Black Lesbian Feminist's Response -- An Interview: Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich -- The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House -- Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference -- The Uses of Anger: Women Responding to Racism -- Learning from the 60s -- Eye to Eye: Black Women, Hatred, and Anger -- Grenada Revisited: An Interim Report}

Our objective is to address a gap in the literature by detailing our validation process, which aligns with qualitative, feminists and intersectional paradigms. We detail the spiral validation method we created, contrasting it with positivist approaches. This process consisted of three phases: a survey, discussion groups, and pilot tests, intersected by review meetings with the INTERMAPS team, the website development company, and the ethical and legal advisors. This iterative process incorporated the selected frameworks, with continuous revisions based on feedback from experts, participants and others in each phase, which contributed to refining the tool. The validation emphasized the concepts of positionality and reflexivity, recognizing that feedback is context-based and shaped by each person's intersectional social positions from which they produce knowledge. The findings underscore the importance of a non-linear, reflexive validation approach, highlighting the tool’s adaptability, inclusivity, and ethical considerations. The results show that ReliefMaps+ and its validation process provides a methodological framework for feminists and intersectional research, offering a model for future methodological innovations grounded in these perspectives.},

And yet, despite the insights that both empirical and theoretical research on scale have generated, there is today no consensus on what is meant by the term or how it should be operationalized. In this paper we critique the dominant – hierarchical – conception of scale, arguing it presents a number of problems that cannot be overcome simply by adding on to or integrating with network theorizing. We thereby propose to eliminate scale as a concept in human geography. In its place we offer a different ontology, one that so flattens scale as to render the concept unnecessary. We conclude by addressing some of the political implications of a human geography without scale.},

In an geographic ecological momentary assessment (GEMA), participants were prompted six times a day on at least 9 days over the course of 3 weeks, covering a total of six weekdays and three weekend days on mobile phones to report their momentary affective well-being. Urban land use categories (forest, water, urban green) were assessed with GPS-localization as environmental variables. Additionally, sunshine, rainfall, whether participants were inside or outside as well as whether they were alone or had company were included into the analyses. We used dynamic structural equation modelling to model the inter- and intraindividual differences as well as fluctuations and assess potential covariates while acknowledging the autoregressive nature of affect. The results showed that on individual level, fluctuations of momentary affective well-being were associated with sunshine, having company and travelling. No significant association emerged for urban green, forest, and water neither within individuals nor between.

She takes on some well-established assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge and the potential of space. The way we think about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects, for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that has been persistently evaded. For Space pursues its argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement, and through telling personal and political reflection. Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how we might develop a responsibility for place beyond place.},

Knowledge producers everywhere are invited to interrupt the continued appropriation of knowledge by capitalism by refusing to participate in corporatized intellectual property regimes. Those who inhabit or are adjacent to dominant structures of power can affirm alternative mediations of intellectual value rooted in feminist and decolonial theories of community, commons, and exchange, rather than legalistic and capitalist property regimes that favour corporations and hyper-individualism.},

The analysis extends research on regional wage differentials to include differentials between men and women in two educational groups at opposite ends of the educational hierarchy. Relative wages across regional labor markets in the United States are modeled in a multilevel framework as outcomes of variation in economic conditions associated with restructuring. Using microdata from the 1990 PUMS-A 5 percent census files, as well as independent sources of macro-data on counties, I show that the direction of wage changes associated with each dimension of restructuring generally does not differ by gender or education. Wages are either higher or lower than the average labor market for all groups. However, there are significant differences in relative wages by gender and many important differences between the two educational groups in the spatial distribution of gender wage inequality. Several “spatial routes” to gender wage equality emerge that differ from the dominant temporal explanations of the declining gender wage gap and differ according to the educational background of workers.},

The present article considers this question via a discussion of the kinds of atmospheric spaces in which the emergence and experience of modern balloon (or aerostatic) flight is implicated. In doing so it argues that aerostatic flight can be understood simultaneously as a technology for moving through atmosphere in a meteorological sense and as an event generative, at least potentially, of atmospheres in an affective sense. This argument is exemplified via a discussion of a particularly notable instance of balloon flight: the attempt, in 1897 by a Swedish engineer, Salomon August Andrée, and two companions, to fly to the North Pole in a hydrogen-filled balloon. Drawing upon a range of contemporaneous accounts, the article makes three claims about the expedition: first, that it can be understood, following Spinoza, as an effort to engineer a mode of addressing the meteorological atmosphere as a relational field of affect; second, that the passage of the expedition can be understood in terms of the registering of atmospheres (in both meteorological and affective terms) in moving, sensing bodies; and third, that the expedition was also generative of a distributed space of anticipation and expectancy. In concluding, the article speculates upon how conceiving of atmospheric space as simultaneously as meteorological and affective might contribute to recent attempts to rethink the materialities of cultural geographies.},

Drawing on feminist scholarship, I call for an emotional geopolitics of fear which connects political processes and everyday emotional topographies in a less hierarchical, more enabling relationship. I employ conscientization as a tool to inform the reconceptualization of global fears within critical geopolitics, and to move forward epistemological practice and our relationship as scholars with social change.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The widely used Swiss neighbourhood index of socioeconomic position (Swiss-SEP 1) was based on data from the 2000 national census on rent, household head education and occupation, and crowding. It may now be out of date. METHODS: We created a new index (Swiss-SEP 2) based on the 2012–2015 yearly micro censuses that have replaced the decennial house-to-house census in Switzerland since 2010. We used principal component analysis on neighbourhood-aggregated variables and standardised the index. We also created a hybrid version (Swiss-SEP 3), with updated values for neighbourhoods centred on buildings constructed after the year 2000 and original values for the remaining neighbourhoods. RESULTS: A total of 1.54 million neighbourhoods were included. With all three indices, the mean yearly equivalised household income increased from around 52,000 to 90,000 CHF from the lowest to the highest index decile. Analyses of mortality were based on 33.6 million person-years of follow-up. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios of all-cause mortality comparing areas in the lowest Swiss-SEP decile with areas of the highest decile were 1.39 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.36–1.41), 1.31 (1.29–1.33) and 1.34 (1.32–1.37) using the old, new and hybrid indices, respectively. DISCUSSION: The Swiss-SEP indices capture area-based SEP at a high resolution and allow the study of SEP when individual-level SEP data are missing or area-level effects are of interest. The hybrid version (Swiss-SEP 3) maintains high spatial resolution while adding information on new neighbourhoods. The index will continue to be useful for Switzerland’s epidemiological and public health research.},

  abstract = {The measurement of everyday music use remains a challenge for researchers, with many of the available methodologies limited by intrusiveness or lack of ecological validity. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) addresses such limitations by assessing current subjective experience at various times throughout participants’ everyday functioning. The aim of the current project was to develop and trial a mobile ESM (m-ESM) capable of collecting event-related data during natural listening episodes. This methodology was designed to maintain a natural and familiar listening experience for participants, and to collect real-time data on personal music listening. An application (app) was created which utilized mobile-device technology, and allowed combination of experience sampling with a personal music player. Analyses were performed on trial data from 101 participants to determine the efficacy of the m-ESM. Results indicated that this methodology would maintain ecological validity and cause minimal intrusion into everyday activities of the listener. Questionnaires were answered immediately at the time of listening, minimizing the problem of retrospective recall biases. This innovative methodology allows for the collection of a wealth of listening data that will advance the accurate measurement of everyday, personal music listening.},

This contributes to a more complex and dynamic understanding of social relations and power structures, and it acknowledges the differences between categories, but it has no methodological direction. I try to take this debate a step forward, by developing what I have called Relief Maps: a new way of collecting, analysing and displaying intersectional data. I consider Relief Maps to be a sound tool for studying the Geographies of Intersectionality, as they show the relationship between three dimensions: power structures (the social), lived experience (the psychological) and places (the geographical). By showing some examples of them, I demonstrate how Relief Maps make empirical work on intersectionality possible and how they are able to take into account both privilege and oppression without using categories in a fixed and rigid way. Taking the spatial dimension as a central part of the analysis, they show how the relationship between power structures varies depending on places and also illustrate how subject formations are done and undone through everyday spaces. Relief Maps aim to take the potentialities of intersectionality and minimise its limitations: they intend to disrupt homogeneous categories while pointing towards the material consequences of oppression. Finally, Relief Maps also provide some insights on intersectionality itself, as they help to think about how power structures relate to each other and the role that experience and place play in these processes.},

\subsection{\textbf{Zentrale Idee}}

\par
Rodó-de-Zárate entwickelt \textbf{Relief Maps} als Methode zur \textbf{empirischen Analyse von Intersektionalität} – mit Fokus auf den Zusammenhang von \textbf{Machtstrukturen, gelebter Erfahrung und Raum}.
\par
\subsection{\textbf{Hintergrund \& Kritik an Intersektionalität}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Ursprünge: Crenshaw (1991), Hooks, Collins – Kritik an einheitlicher „Frauen“-Kategorie.
\item Wichtig: Machtstrukturen wie \textbf{Gender, Race, Class, Sexuality, Age} wirken \textbf{gleichzeitig} und \textbf{verändern sich im Raum}.
\item 
\par
Kritik:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Begriffsunschärfe (vage, unvollständig).
\item Keine klare \textbf{methodologische Richtung}.
\item Gefahr der \textbf{Essenzialisierung} (wenn Kategorien als fix betrachtet werden).
\item Risiko des „Oppression Olympics“ (wer ist am meisten unterdrückt?).

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Relief Maps – Konzeption}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Ziel:}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Sichtbarmachen von Intersektionalität \textbf{ohne feste Kategorien}.
\item Analyse von \textbf{Erfahrungen in Bezug auf Orte und Machtverhältnisse}.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Drei Dimensionen:}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Soziale Dimension}: Machtstrukturen (Gender, Sexualität, etc.)
\item \textbf{Geografische Dimension}: Orte (z.\,B. Schule, Straße, Zuhause)
\item \textbf{Psychologische Dimension}: Gelebte Erfahrung (Komfort ↔ Unbehagen)

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Begriff "Relief"}:}

\begin{itemize}

\item Topografisch: Höhen und Tiefen = Erfahrungen von Privileg / Unterdrückung.
\item Emotional: Orte der \textbf{Entlastung} vs. Orte der \textbf{Belastung}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Konstruktion der Relief Maps}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Grundlage: Interviews + Fokusgruppen.
\item Ziel: Erfahrungsräume junger Menschen in Manresa (Spanien) verstehen.
\item 
\par
Vorgehen:
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item Orte aus Alltag der Befragten identifizieren.
\item Erfahrungen zu jedem Ort in Bezug auf Identitäten erfassen.
\item Punkte (für jede Machtstruktur) auf einer Skala von Unbehagen zu Komfort platzieren.
\item Linien verbinden die Punkte → zeigen Bewegung, Entwicklung, Ausweichstrategien.
\item Pfeile zeigen \textbf{intensivierende oder abschwächende Wechselwirkungen} zwischen Machtstrukturen.

\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Klassifikation von Orten (nicht starr):}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Orte der Unterdrückung}
\item \textbf{Kontroverse Orte} (Ambivalenz)
\item \textbf{Neutrale Orte}
\item \textbf{Orte der Entlastung} (z.\,B. feministische Gruppenräume, Zuhause)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Beispiele}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Queralt (17, lesbisch, weiß):}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Fußballplatz = ambivalent: Empowerment durch queeres Umfeld, aber Ausschluss wegen Klasse.
\item Les Carpes (Nachtclub) = starke Unterdrückung (Gewalt wegen Homosexualität).
\item Ateneu \& Zuhause = Orte der Entlastung.
\item Pfeile zeigen z.\,B. wie \textbf{Genderstrategien} (Kapuzenpulli) helfen, sich im öffentlichen Raum sicherer zu fühlen.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Laila (26, marokkanisch, heterosexuell):}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Zuhause und Nachbarschaft = starke Kontrolle durch Religion \& Ehemann → \textbf{Genderunterdrückung}.
\item Barcelona = Ort der Entlastung.
\item Ethnizität spielt ambivalente Rolle: wird nicht direkt als unterdrückend erlebt, aber intensiviert Genderkontrolle.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Nil (21, weiß, cis, hetero):}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Meistens neutrale Erfahrungen → \textbf{sichtbar wird das Privileg}.
\item Nur Zuhause: Alterskonflikt.
\item Relief Map zeigt \textbf{Normalität der Privilegierung}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Potenziale \& Weiterentwicklungen}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Zeitdimension} integrierbar (z.\,B. Dauer an einem Ort → Farbabstufung).
\item \textbf{Körper} als Ort (Ort der Unterdrückung / Entlastung).
\item \textbf{Größe der Punkte} = Grad der Identifikation mit Ort.
\item Verknüpfung mit \textbf{GIS}: Verortung der Relief Maps in realen Karten (vgl. Kwan 2002).
\item Verwendung in \textbf{therapeutischen / pädagogischen Kontexten}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Beitrag zur Theoriebildung}}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\par
Relief Maps:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Vermeiden \textbf{fixe Kategorien}, zeigen \textbf{strukturelle Positionierungen}.
\item \textbf{Keine additive Logik} (nicht einfach: Frau + queer = doppelt unterdrückt).
\item Zeigen \textbf{Verhältnisse \& Dynamiken} zwischen Machtachsen.
\item Kombinieren \textbf{materialistische Perspektive} (Raum, Körper) mit \textbf{poststrukturalistischer Kritik} (Kategorien hinterfragen).

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Fazit}}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Raum ist zentral} für das Erleben von Machtverhältnissen.
\item 
\par
Relief Maps ermöglichen:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item eine \textbf{situierte Analyse von Intersektionalität},
\item \textbf{vergleichende Darstellungen} ohne Vereinfachung,
\item neue Formen von \textbf{Empirie \& Visualisierung} in der feministischen Geographie.

\end{itemize}

\item Sie bieten eine \textbf{praktische Methodologie} und \textbf{konzeptionelles Werkzeug} zugleich.

Crenshaw referred to Black women’s experiences of oppression as the phenomenon to be studied and the reason why new theoretical tools, such as intersectionality, were needed. Here I approach intersectionality and lived experience from an emotional and geographic perspective, focusing on how spatiality is lived and constructed through emotions and on their role in (re)producing intersectional dynamics. I rely on Ahmed’s (Feminist Theory, Vol. 8 [2007], 149–68) conceptualization of (dis)comforts and the inhabitability of places by different bodies to show the genuinely spatial character of emotions. Applying the conceptualization to an intersectional framework, I develop a differentiation of (dis)comforts in relation to geometries of power and argue that emotions and their spatialities can be used as pointers to intersectional inequalities. I illustrate the theoretical proposals through the Relief Maps as a tool for the collection, analysis, and visualization of the social, geographic, and emotional dimensions of intersectional inequalities and reflect on how feminist research methods could consider emotions for studying intersectional dynamics.},

I take up two key heuristics of lockdown digital well-being—attention and intimacy—and draw upon feminist political geography to examine the alignments between attentional and intimate practices by means of digital technology during lockdown. Through four in-depth interviews conducted during this time, I focus on the connections between participants’ political intimacies, emotional geographies, and (self-)care practices. The paper identifies a disconnect between experiences of unwell-being and practices of (self-)care emerging from popular conceptions of digital well-being, specifically regarding practices of ‘doomscrolling.’ Drawing upon Sarah Atkinson’s (2011) work on the discontinuities between scales of care and responsibility, I argue for a reworking of discourses and practices of digital well-being through care-ful distraction: the unruly use of our increasingly co-constituted attentional capacities and intimate relations to practice care within, and for, the sociotechnical systems which bind us together.},

The empirical analysis of data collected in Hong Kong is used to elaborate and support two main claims. The first is that geography matters to not only overall well-being but also momentary well-being and that researchers should be careful to specify the influence of geographical context correctly. We therefore employ an approach that is informed by various strands of time–geographical thought and find that life satisfaction is associated more strongly with geographical context than is momentary well-being. Second, we confirm positive relations between social contacts and experienced well-being but extend earlier research by showing that these relations stretch across multiple timescales and depend to some extent on the duration of an activity episode and with whom the activity episode is undertaken. This means that the use of simple indicators of social capital is inadequate for making the complex linkages between well-being and people's social contacts understandable in empirical research.},

We acknowledge a range of conflicting opinions about the suitability of current quantitative techniques. To contribute to this debate, we assess the conceptualizations of intersectionality embedded in the most common approach to quantitative analysis, multiple regression. We identify three features of intersectional analysis highlighted in the feminist literature: (1) attention to context; (2) a heuristic approach to identifying relevant dimensions of inequality; (3) and addressing the complex, multidimensional structuring of inequality. Using these criteria, we evaluate: (1) multiple regression including context as a higher-order interaction; (2) multiple regressions run within different contexts and compared; and (3) multilevel regression including context as a higher-order level of analysis. We demonstrate with research illustrations that the models do a progressively better job at satisfying the criteria. We conclude that the third model offers a conceptualization of intersectionality that is the most consistent with the feminist literature.},

  abstract = {Assessment in clinical psychology typically relies on global retrospective self-reports collected at research or clinic visits, which are limited by recall bias and are not well suited to address how behavior changes over time and across contexts. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

It critically analyses themes from the ‘science of happiness’ for their focus on a decontextualized and individualized subject and highlights the emergence of an alternative, developing geographical research agenda in the study of wellbeing, termed here ‘intra-active wellbeing’. It is argued that this research agenda draws together formerly disparate aspects of geographical thought – classically humanistic wellbeing research and more-than-human inquiry – and creates space for a more pluralistic field of wellbeing scholarship.},

This study examines recall bias in the relationship between mobility-based greenery and people’s short-term happiness across activity contexts, including homes, workplaces, recreational activity sites, and travel routes. It compares Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA) with the DRM. GEMA is a method that integrates Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) with Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The results indicate that people’s short-term happiness and mobility-based greenery exposure were underestimated as measured via the DRM’s recall data, particularly for outdoor recreational activity sites and travel routes. The GEMA effectively mitigates the recall bias issues inherent in the DRM.},

First we discuss privacy requirements grounded in both historic and contemporary perspectives on privacy. We use a three-layer model of user privacy concerns to relate them to system operations (data transfer, storage and processing) and examine their effects on user behavior. In the second part of the paper we develop guidelines for building privacy-friendly systems. We distinguish two approaches: "privacy-by-policy" and "privacy-by-architecture." The privacy-by-policy approach focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices (FIPs), while the privacy-by-architecture approach minimizes the collection of identifiable personal data and emphasizes anonymization and client-side data storage and processing. We discuss both approaches with a view to their technical overlaps and boundaries as well as to economic feasibility. The paper aims to introduce engineers and computer scientists to the privacy research domain and provide concrete guidance on how to design privacy-friendly systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing international interest in the concept of mental well-being and its contribution to all aspects of human life. Demand for instruments to monitor mental well-being at a population level and evaluate mental health promotion initiatives is growing. This article describes the development and validation of a new scale, comprised only of positively worded items relating to different aspects of positive mental health: the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). METHODS: WEMWBS was developed by an expert panel drawing on current academic literature, qualitative research with focus groups, and psychometric testing of an existing scale. It was validated on a student and representative population sample. Content validity was assessed by reviewing the frequency of complete responses and the distribution of responses to each item. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the scale measured a single construct. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Criterion validity was explored in terms of correlations between WEMWBS and other scales and by testing whether the scale discriminated between population groups in line with pre-specified hypotheses. Test-retest reliability was assessed at one week using intra-class correlation coefficients. Susceptibility to bias was measured using the Balanced Inventory of Desired Responding. RESULTS: WEMWBS showed good content validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the single factor hypothesis. A Cronbach's alpha score of 0.89 (student sample) and 0.91 (population sample) suggests some item redundancy in the scale. WEMWBS showed high correlations with other mental health and well-being scales and lower correlations with scales measuring overall health. Its distribution was near normal and the scale did not show ceiling effects in a population sample. It discriminated between population groups in a way that is largely consistent with the results of other population surveys. Test-retest reliability at one week was high (0.83). Social desirability bias was lower or similar to that of other comparable scales. CONCLUSION: WEMWBS is a measure of mental well-being focusing entirely on positive aspects of mental health. As a short and psychometrically robust scale, with no ceiling effects in a population sample, it offers promise as a tool for monitoring mental well-being at a population level. Whilst WEMWBS should appeal to those evaluating mental health promotion initiatives, it is important that the scale's sensitivity to change is established before it is recommended in this context.},

Since its first publication in 1998, the WHO-5 has been translated into more than 30 languages and has been used in research studies all over the world. We now provide a systematic review of the literature on the WHO-5. Methods: We conducted a systematic search for literature on the WHO-5 in PubMed and PsycINFO in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. In our review of the identified articles, we focused particularly on the following aspects: (1) the clinimetric validity of the WHO-5; (2) the responsiveness/sensitivity of the WHO-5 in controlled clinical trials; (3) the potential of the WHO-5 as a screening tool for depression, and (4) the applicability of the WHO-5 across study fields. Results: A total of 213 articles met the predefined criteria for inclusion in the review. The review demonstrated that the WHO-5 has high clinimetric validity, can be used as an outcome measure balancing the wanted and unwanted effects of treatments, is a sensitive and specific screening tool for depression and its applicability across study fields is very high. Conclusions: The WHO-5 is a short questionnaire consisting of 5 simple and non-invasive questions, which tap into the subjective well-being of the respondents. The scale has adequate validity both as a screening tool for depression and as an outcome measure in clinical trials and has been applied successfully across a wide range of study fields.},

Although research within the field of feminist geography has explored particular interconnections such as those between gender and race, the theoretical concept of intersectionality as debated in the wider social sciences has not been addressed. This article attempts to respond to that omission. It begins by tracing the emergence of debates about the interconnections between gender and other identities. It goes on to reflect on attempts to map geometries of oppressions. The emphasis then moves from theorizing intersectionality to questioning how it can be researched in practice by presenting a case study to illustrate intersectionality as lived experience. The conclusion demonstrates the contribution that feminist geography can make to advance the theorization of intersectionality through its appreciation of the significance of space in processes of subject formation. It calls for feminist geography to pay more attention to questions of power and social inequalities.},

  abstract = {Platform-based services are rapidly transforming urban work, lives and spaces around the world. The rise of platforms dependent on largely expendable labour relations, with significant migrant involvement, must be seen as connected, and as replicating larger social processes rather than merely technological changes. This perspective paper urgently calls for an intersectional perspective to better understand social-technical relations crossing the digital-urban interface of platform urbanism in contemporary European cities. Critics of platforms and gig work, to date, have mainly focused on algorithms-based social control, degraded working conditions, problematic employment relations and precariousness of gig work. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has~both disrupted and amplified these issues, intensifying the vulnerability of gig workers. For example, in Sweden, migrant groups and gig workers were separately identified as being hardest hit by Covid, but with little attention to the interconnectivity between these categories, nor to how these groups are co-positioned vis-a-vis larger socio-economic inequalities. Thus, we argue for a deeper understanding of the social processes underlying platforms and for active investigation of how inequalities are being produced and/or maintained in/by these processes. Urban planners, designers and policy makers will need to actively address the hybrid (digital and physical) urban spaces produced in platform urbanism in order to prevent spatial and economic inequalities. We argue for a stronger recognition of interrelated and overlapping social categories such as gender and migrant status as central to the construction of mutually constitutive systems of oppression and discrimination produced in and through the platform urbanism.},

Heat exposure and vulnerability to heat may vary within cities depending on structural features and socioeconomic factors. This study examined the effect modification of the temperature-mortality association of three socio-environmental factors in eight Swiss cities and population subgroups ({$<$}75 and~≥~75 years, males, females): urban heat islands (UHI) based on within-city temperature contrasts, residential greenness measured as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP). We used individual death records from the Swiss National Cohort occurring during the warm season (May to September) in the years 2003–2016. We performed a case time series analysis using conditional quasi-Poisson and distributed lag non-linear models with a lag of 0–3 days. As exposure variables, we used daily maximum temperatures (Tmax) and a binary indicator for warm nights (Tmin ≥20~°C). In total, 53,593 deaths occurred during the study period. Overall across the eight cities, the mortality risk increased by 31\% (1.31 relative risk (95\% confidence interval: 1.20–1.42)) between 22.5~°C (the minimum mortality temperature) and 35~°C (the 99th percentile) for warm-season Tmax. Stratified analysis suggested that the heat-related risk at 35~°C is 26\% (95\%CI: −4\%, 67\%) higher in UHI compared to non-UHI areas. Indications of smaller risk differences were observed between the low vs. high greenness strata (Relative risk difference~=~13\% (95\%CI: −11\%; 44\%)). Living in low SEP neighborhoods was associated with an increased heat related risk in the non-elderly population ({$<$}75 years). Our results indicate that UHI are associated with increased heat-related mortality risk within Swiss cities, and that features beyond greenness are responsible for such spatial risk differences.},

From social media to artificial intelligence, our world is now governed by algorithms, powerful tools that not only predict human behaviour but affect how we look at each other, and ourselves. At the same time, we are seeing hard-fought-for women's rights being recontested and women feeling increasingly threatened. In America, Roe v Wade has been overturned, while in Australia, the number of sexual assaults reported to police has increased year on year for the past decade. Could it be that the digital revolution is killing feminism? Time to Reboot explores the new digital gender divide. It shows how the algorithms favoured by Big Tech, designed to respond to and reinforce group characteristics, are dramatically recasting our relationships and our personal values. AI trained on biased data is generating a new wave of male privilege, sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant. In the 2020s, the 'virtual rape' of female players in online gaming is rarely commented on, while feminist values are in record decline among a younger generation swayed by an online ethos that promotes tech libertarianism and rewards the obsessive cultivation of self-image. This book unpacks the uncomfortable parallels between a digital and tech consumer culture we find impossible to resist and the nascent decline of gender equity. It questions whether the technology that is meant to both guide us today and show us the future is, in fact, pushing women backwards - and if so, how we can fix this.},

Many digital health studies adopt an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology, which can be extended by incorporating the collection of participant location data via embedded technology within smartphones. However, there is currently a lack of customizable, geographically appropriate software for researchers to implement geographically explicit EMA (GEMA). To address this gap, we developed the Healthy Environments and Active Living for Translational Health (HEALTH) Platform. The HEALTH Platform is a customizable smartphone application that enables researchers to deliver GEMA prompts on a smartphone in real-time based on spatially complex geofence boundaries, collect audiovisual data, and flexibly adjust system logic without the need for time-consuming updates to the application on a participant’s device. We illustrate the HEALTH Platform’s capabilities through a study of park exposure and well-being. This study demonstrates the HEALTH Platform’s improvements upon existing GEMA software platforms. We observed survey prompt adherence is associated with participant motivation and the complexity of the survey instrument itself, following past EMA research findings. Overall, we find that the HEALTH Platform is a flexible mobile phone application for implementing the GEMA methodology in digital health research and practice and can be used to meet critical quality standards in this rapidly evolving field.},

  abstract = {Objective: Two well-being scales were administered to participants attending personal transformational workshops; the International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short-form (I-PANAS-SF) and the Affective Well-Being Scale. Data were collected before and after workshops occurring between March 17, 2018, and November 4, 2020, during which 1,175 unique records were collected. A previous publication reports on changes in I-PANAS-SF results, comparing before and after the workshops. This study compares the I-PANAS-SF results with those of the Affective Well-Being Scale obtained from these same study participants. Results: The two well-being scales yielded similar results. While the I-PANAS-SF scale produced more nuanced results, the additional time required must be balanced against the value of the additional information gained.},

The first explores the notion of ‘belonging’ and the different analytical levels on which it needs to be studied: social locations; identifications and emotional attachments; and ethical and political values. The second part focuses on the politics of belonging and how it relates to the participatory politics of citizenship as well as to that of entitlement and status. The third part illustrates, using British examples, some of the ways particular political projects of belonging select specific levels of belonging in order to construct their projects.},

It compares the debate on these issues that took place in Britain in the 1980s and around the 2001 UN World Conference Against Racism. It examines issues such as the relative helpfulness of additive or mutually constitutive models of intersectional social divisions; the different analytical levels at which social divisions need to be studied, their ontological base and their relations to each other. The final section of the article attempts critically to assess a specific intersectional methodological approach for engaging in aid and human rights work in the South.},

Digital borders are not just national borders, and the effects of digital borders can be analysed at a multitude of geographical scales, from the regional to the neighbourhood, and from the national territory to the bordered and bounded instant messaging group. The contributions to this special issue reveal the diverse ways in which borders and sovereignty are developed as well as how these processes are contested in ways that call into question pre-existing conceptualisations of digital relations, particularly the understanding of the internet as borderless.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Noise annoyance is considered to be the most widespread and recognized health effect of environmental noise. Previous research is~mostly based on the static study of residential environmental noise, but few studies have focused on the effects of noise exposure in different activity contexts on real-time annoyance. The two deficiency are that they neglect the influence of activity context besides residence and fail to reflect the difference of time-scale effect of noise influence.                                         Methods               Using portable noise and air sensors, GPS-equipped mobile phones, questionnaire survey, and geographic ecological momentary assessment (GEMA), this paper measured the environmental noise and real-time noise annoyance of participants at different activity places. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of environmental noise on people’s real-time annoyance. The paper further considered the influence of the~geographic context of the activity places and daily acoustic environment on participants’ real-time annoyance. Further, a nonlinear regression model was constructed using Random Forest to further examine the nonlinear relationship between environmental noise and real-time annoyance.                                         Results               The results showed that: (1) the average cumulative equivalent sound level during was 55~dB (A) when the participants responded to the EMA surveys; (2) Only the temperature of activity places had an influence on momentary annoyance and the higher the temperature, the more likely participants were annoyed; (3) Participants with higher perception of noise pollution in residential communities were more likely to be annoyed. However, participants with higher daily exposure to noise were less likely to feel annoyed; (4) The threshold value of the effect of noise on real-time annoyance was 58~dB (A) to 78~dB (A).                                         Conclusions               These findings can guide the development of urban planning and environmental noise standards and also provide a reference for noise barrier requirements for different activity places.},

  abstract = {Research on environmental exposure and its impacts on people’s mood has attracted increasing attention. Most studies focus on the spatiality of geographic contexts, but they neglect the influence of temporality in the relationships between environments and mood. To this end, a survey was conducted in January 2019 in Guangzhou, China, and measured data (micro-environments, built environments, EMA records, GPS trajectories, and activity logs) covering a weekday were collected from 125 participants. Then, multiple linear regression models are employed to examine and compare the associations between environments and mood based on three possible types of temporal responses (cumulative response, momentary response, and time-lagged response). The results indicate that there are great differences in environmental mood effects based on different types of temporal responses. Specifically, (i) for three types of temporal responses, exposure to PM2.5 and noise have mood-blunting effects, whereas exposure to green spaces has mood-augmenting effects. (ii) For two types of temporal responses, higher temperature (in winter) may positively influence individual mood based on cumulative and time-lagged response, and higher POI density can positively affect mood based on cumulative and momentary response. (iii) Relative humidity may not have time-related effects on mood. Although all three types of temporal responses are observed in this study, the most significant manifestation is momentary response. These findings not only enrich theoretical research on environmental mood effects and temporality, but also inform the practice of more refined and humanistic urban planning, environmental governance, and public services.},
