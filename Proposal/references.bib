	abstract = {Existing evidence on the beneficial effects of nature on mental health comes from studies using cross-sectional designs. We developed a smartphone-based tool (Urban Mind; www.urbanmind.info) to examine how exposure to natural features within the built environment affects mental well-being in real time. The tool was used to monitor 108 individuals who completed 3013 assessments over a 1-week period. Significant immediate and lagged associations with mental well-being were found for several natural features. These associations were stronger in people with higher trait impulsivity, a psychological measure of one's tendency to behave with little forethought or consideration of the consequences, which is indicative of a higher risk of developing mental-health issues. Our investigation suggests that the benefits of nature on mental well-being are time-lasting and interact with an individual's vulnerability to mental illness. These findings have potential implications from the perspectives of global mental health as well as urban planning and design.},

This contributes to a more complex and dynamic understanding of social relations and power structures, and it acknowledges the differences between categories, but it has no methodological direction. I try to take this debate a step forward, by developing what I have called Relief Maps: a new way of collecting, analysing and displaying intersectional data. I consider Relief Maps to be a sound tool for studying the Geographies of Intersectionality, as they show the relationship between three dimensions: power structures (the social), lived experience (the psychological) and places (the geographical). By showing some examples of them, I demonstrate how Relief Maps make empirical work on intersectionality possible and how they are able to take into account both privilege and oppression without using categories in a fixed and rigid way. Taking the spatial dimension as a central part of the analysis, they show how the relationship between power structures varies depending on places and also illustrate how subject formations are done and undone through everyday spaces. Relief Maps aim to take the potentialities of intersectionality and minimise its limitations: they intend to disrupt homogeneous categories while pointing towards the material consequences of oppression. Finally, Relief Maps also provide some insights on intersectionality itself, as they help to think about how power structures relate to each other and the role that experience and place play in these processes.},

But, if you type in “white girls,” the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about “why black women are so sassy” or “why black women are so angry” presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society. In Algorithms of Oppression , Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color. Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance—operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond—understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance. An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.},

This study investigates the association between visits to canals and rivers and mental wellbeing. We addressed the following questions: Are visits to canals and rivers associated with higher levels of mental wellbeing? Does this association depend on age and gender? Does this association vary between people with and without a diagnosis on mental illness? We used Urban Mind, a flexible smartphone application for examining the impact of different aspects of the built and social environment on mental wellbeing, a strong predictor of mental health. Participants were invited to complete an ecological momentary assessment three times a day for fourteen days. Each assessment included questions about their surrounding environment and mental wellbeing. A total of 7,975 assessments were completed by 299 participants including 87 with a diagnosis of mental illness. Multilevel regression models were used to analyse the data. We found positive associations between visits to canals and rivers and mental wellbeing (p {\textless} .05) when compared to being anywhere else and when compared to being in green spaces. Increases in mental wellbeing were still evident after the visit had taken place. These effects remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity and education, and were consistent in people with and without a diagnosis of mental illness. Spending time near canals and rivers is associated with better mental wellbeing. These findings have potential implications for mental health as well as urban planning and policy. Visits to canals and rivers could become part of social prescribing schemes, playing a role in preventing mental health difficulties and complementing more traditional interventions.},

We collected data from 221 participants from two communities in Hong Kong, i.e., Sham Shui Po (SSP) and Tin Shui Wai (TSW), using a stratified random sampling approach. Big datasets were also used to derive relevant built-environment features at the street block level. We used structural equation modeling to explore the complex relationships among housing characteristics, built-environment features, and mental health. The results indicate that the associations between built-environment quality and people’s mental health are weak. For communities with relatively poor housing conditions (i.e., SSP in this study), the impact of housing characteristics on mental health may be more direct; for communities with relatively good housing conditions (i.e., TSW in this study), the effect of housing characteristics on mental health may be indirect. Our findings shed light on the importance of considering different contexts in developing policies related to housing and built environment and mental health.},

	abstract = {Platform-based services are rapidly transforming urban work, lives and spaces around the world. The rise of platforms dependent on largely expendable labour relations, with significant migrant involvement, must be seen as connected, and as replicating larger social processes rather than merely technological changes. This perspective paper urgently calls for an intersectional perspective to better understand social-technical relations crossing the digital-urban interface of platform urbanism in contemporary European cities. Critics of platforms and gig work, to date, have mainly focused on algorithms-based social control, degraded working conditions, problematic employment relations and precariousness of gig work. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has both disrupted and amplified these issues, intensifying the vulnerability of gig workers. For example, in Sweden, migrant groups and gig workers were separately identified as being hardest hit by Covid, but with little attention to the interconnectivity between these categories, nor to how these groups are co-positioned vis-a-vis larger socio-economic inequalities. Thus, we argue for a deeper understanding of the social processes underlying platforms and for active investigation of how inequalities are being produced and/or maintained in/by these processes. Urban planners, designers and policy makers will need to actively address the hybrid (digital and physical) urban spaces produced in platform urbanism in order to prevent spatial and economic inequalities. We argue for a stronger recognition of interrelated and overlapping social categories such as gender and migrant status as central to the construction of mutually constitutive systems of oppression and discrimination produced in and through the platform urbanism.},

After the Netherlands won the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) in Israel in 2019, it became known that the 65th ESC would be hosted in Rotterdam. As Rotterdam-Zuid is frequently seen as a shabby and disadvantaged district of Rotterdam which contains many poor households of the Netherlands, this research aims to investigate how the ESC can positively influence the pace of existing urban renewal projects (as included in the NPRZ) in Rotterdam-Zuid to improve its backlog. This study uses a qualitative approach that allows for an in-depth analysis of participants’ perceptions of the situation with the help of semi-structured interviews. According to the results it was found that due to the ongoing (long-term) area development, the design of the surrounding environment of Ahoy, the restricting measures of the corona pandemic and lack of generating fiscal transfers, the ESC has little to no influence on existing urban renewal projects or other spatial projects in Rotterdam-Zuid.},

Building on Cynthia Weber’s reading the persona of the 2014 Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst with ‘queer intellectual curiosity’, this article demonstrates that Eurovision shifted from, in the late 1990s, an emerging site of gay and trans visibility to, by 2008–2014, part of a larger discursive circuit taking in international mega-events like the Olympics, international human-rights advocacy, Europe–Russia relations and the politics of state homophobia and transphobia. Contest organisers thus had to take positions — ranging from detachment to celebration — about ‘lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender’ politics in host states and the Eurovision region. The construction of spatio-temporal hierarchies around attitudes to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, however, revealed exclusions that corroborate other critical arguments on the reconfiguration of national and European identities around ‘lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality’.},

In 1993, when former Warsaw Pact states began to participate in Eurovision for the first time and Yugoslav successor states started to compete in their own right, the contest remained a one-night-peryear theatrical presentation staged in venues that accommodated, at most, a couple of thousand spectators and with points awarded by expert juries from each participating country. Between 1998 and 2004, Eurovision’s organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and the national broadcasters responsible for hosting each edition of the contest expanded it into an ever grander spectacle: hosted in arenas before live audiences of 10,000 or more, with (from 2004) a semi-final system enabling every eligible country and broadcaster to participate each year, and with (between 1998 and 2008) points awarded almost entirely on the basis of telephone voting by audiences in each participating state.},

As economic and budgetary scandal marred the event, many bystanders questioned the meaning and sense of this mega event, which we consequently set out to explore. The event was organized and realized as what we term a cross-sectorial innovation project, bringing together a broad array of actors from the public and private sector who collaboratively sought to turn the event into “much more than a song contest”. We explore this “much more” by describing the actors’ arduous work to create value through different project logics that were brought to the table. Hence, we argue, the event can be understood as what Mauss termed a total social phenomenon in which much more than merely economic issues are at stake. However, in valuing the event not much work was put into enacting values transgressing the realm of the quantifiable, which left these as intangibles. As a consequence, we urge for a more engaged and caring approach to valuating cross-sectorial innovation projects.},

	abstract = {For some time it has been argued that cities all over the world have become more entrepreneurial and increasingly competitive. Most research has focused on spectacular events in well-known metropolises, but far less is known about how smaller cities engage in competitive activities. This paper focuses on how, why and what Swedish cities hope to achieve by engaging themselves in hosting the tryouts to the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), which provides an opportunity for a critical case study of place marketing and city competition in Sweden. The empirical material is based on interviews with stakeholders in the tryouts. Our findings show that the local authorities do not compete in the same way as suggested by the literature, but instead collaborate to a great deal. While there are various motives behind arranging a tryouts tryout, it is noted that whereas the ESC presents an opportunity for a host city to ‘place itself on the map’, hosting a tryout is often mainly seen as an opportunity to show the organisers of the event the city's potential for hosting other events in the future. Our findings suggest that the main outcome of hosting a tryout, an outcome that the local authorities seem content with, is having arranged a glamorous party for the local inhabitants. The paper concludes by discussing why competition was found to be less outspoken than the literature suggests.},

More-than-human geographies, actor-network theory, and new materialism have all called for attending to technological infrastructures and artefacts. This attention is directed mainly towards large-scale technologies. What often escapes geographies of technoscience are small, mundane, and unspectacular technologies. Bringing into conversation work from feminist technoscience and feminist geographies, we broaden the understanding of technology in geographies of technoscience by developing the concept of intimate technologies. By exploring three sites that lie at the centre of feminist technoscience – the home, the laboratory, and the clinic – we carve out the spatial politics of intimate technologies.},

GIS has also proved a core concern of the growing interdisciplinary field of the digital humanities. With the use of qualitative and quantitative methods in dialogue, projects in digital humanities promote continued interdisciplinary conversation, which can support significant headway for future digital geographic research.

	abstract = {The value of a non-pecuniary (free) product is inherently difficult to assess. A pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing OSS usage by millions of global firms. We first estimate the supply-side value by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demand side value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is \$4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at \$8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84\% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96\% of the demand-side value is created by only 5\% of OSS developers.},

This hurts the people that work and learn in them and limits the potential for universities to contribute to a better world. But we can raise our expectations. Hawkins and Kern envision a university transformed by collaboration, care, equity, justice, and multiple knowledges. Drawing on real-world, international examples where people and institutions are already doing things in new ways, Higher Expectations offers concrete advice on how to make these transformations real. It covers many areas of academic life including course design, conferencing, administration, research teams, managing workloads and more. Designed for faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other scholars, Higher Expectations delivers hope and practical actions you can take to start making change now.

In Alang ship breaking yard majority of the labourers are migrated from different states of the country viz, U.P., Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand and Gujarat. There are various factors associated with the migration of labour from their place of origin to Alang ship breaking yard. The aim of this paper is to focus on the process of migration of labour to Alang ship breaking yard and also on the differentials and determinants of migration. This paper also tries to identify the factors influencing out-migration of the rural poor labour.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

	abstract = {More than 80\% of international trade in goods by volume is carried by sea. The shipping industry constitutes a key element in the infrastructure of the world's social metabolism. Ocean-going ships are owned and used for their trade by developed countries but are often demolished, together with their toxic materials, in developing countries. Ship breaking is the process of dismantling an obsolete vessel's structure for scrapping or disposal. The Alang–Sosiya yard (India), one of the world largest shipbreaking yards, is studied here with particular attention to toxic waste management. Ship owners and ship breakers obtain large profits dumping the environmental costs on workers, local farmers and fishers. This unequal distribution of benefits and burdens, due to an international and national uneven distribution of power, has led to an ecological distribution conflict. The controversy at the Indian Supreme Court in 2006 over the dismantling of the ocean liner ‘Blue Lady,’ shows how the different languages of valuation expressed by different social groups clashed and how a language that expresses sustainability as monetary benefit at the national scale, dominated. Shipbreaking in the developing world is not just an externality but a successful case of cost shifting, or else, profit accumulation by contamination.},

Moreover, the concept of the ‘globalisation’—a totalising and capitalist-centric concept that homogenises the entire planet into a territory to conquer—has become incapable of adequately accounting for the planetary events taking place. To date, geographical literature has used the term ‘planetary’ in important, but disparate ways; and in so doing, underplaying the emancipatory potential the concept has in resisting the totalising concept of the ‘globalisation’. This paper looks to the wider humanities and social science to offer four propositions—materiality, human as praxis, antinational and safeguarding—the planetary can be more coherently conceptualised geographically.},

However, despite an apparent agreement that AI should be ‘ethical’, there is debate about both what constitutes ‘ethical AI’ and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {The modern age has heralded a shift from the industrial society, in which natural resources are crucial input factors for the economy, towards a knowledge society. To date, sustainability literature has treated knowledge—and in particular digital artifacts—mainly as a means to the end of achieving sustainable development. In this conceptual paper, we argue that digital artifacts themselves ought also to be considered as resources, which also need to be sustainable. While over-consumption is a problem facing natural resources, with sustainable digital artifacts, underproduction, and underuse are the biggest challenges. In our view, the sustainability of digital artifacts improves their potential impact on sustainable development. A theoretical foundation for digital artifacts and their ecosystem allows us to present the relevant research on digital information, knowledge management, digital goods, and innovation literature. Based on these insights, we propose ten basic conditions for sustainable digital artifacts and their ecosystem to ensure that they provide the greatest possible benefit for sustainable development. We then apply those characteristics to four exemplary cases: Linux kernel development, Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the Wikipedia project, and the Linking Open Drug Data repositories. The paper concludes with a research agenda identifying topics for sustainability scholars and information systems academics, as well as practitioners. A number of suggestions for future studies on digital sustainability are also put forward.},

	abstract = {Conflict minerals refer to raw materials associated with conflicts and human rights violations in conflict zones around the world. Concern about the lack of transparency in the mineral supply chains of global corporations has led to increased stakeholder concern and pressure through protest action. In particular since 2009, numerous public-private collaborations, including collaborations with NGOs and industry-led initiatives, have sought greater transparency in companies' sourcing from conflict mineral zones. This has led to the enactment of the ‘Dodd-Frank Act’ in the US to regulate the disclosure of involvement in conflict minerals. This requirement suggests that corporate obligations now go beyond their own operations and that companies are held accountable for the actions of their suppliers with regards to their supply chains. While the act requires minimum disclosure by companies, we hypothesise that companies’ collaboration with social movement NGOs and activist protests against companies will influence the comprehensiveness of their conflict mineral disclosures. Our hypothesis is grounded in social movement theory and the theory of collaboration. We test our hypothesis by focusing on a sample of global electronic reliant companies from 20 countries. Consistent with our expectations, we find that collaboration with NGOs (as social movement organizations) and activist protest lead to more comprehensive, and therefore more transparent, disclosures. Our findings suggest that in the presence of activist protest, NGO collaboration with corporations has a higher impact on the comprehensiveness of conflict mineral disclosures. Furthermore, the marginal effects on disclosure are more strongly driven by NGO collaboration than activist protest. Our findings have practical and policy implications in that improved corporate transparency is the result of social movement actions via NGOs, i.e., regulation on its own may not result in comprehensive disclosures.},

	abstract = {Technologies for storing, transmitting, and processing information have made astounding progress in dematerialization. The amount of physical mass needed to represent one bit of information has dramatically decreased in the last few years, and is still declining. However, information will always need a material basis. In this chapter, we address both the upstream (from mining to the product) and the downstream (from the product to final disposal) implications of the composition of an average Swiss end-of-life (EoL) consumer ICT device from a materials perspective. Regarding the upstream implications, we calculate the scores of the MIPS material rucksack indicator and the ReCiPe mineral resource depletion indicator for selected materials contained in ICT devices, namely polymers, the base metals Al, Cu, and Fe, and the geochemically scarce metals Ag, Au, and Pd. For primary production of one kg of raw material found in consumer ICT devices, the highest material rucksack and resource depletion scores are obtained for the three scarce metals Ag, Au, and Pd; almost the entire material rucksack for these metals is determined by the mining and refining processes. This picture changes when indicator scores are scaled to their relative mass per kg average Swiss EoL consumer ICT device: the base metals Fe and in particular Cu now score much higher than the scarce metals for both indicators. Regarding the downstream implications, we determine the effects of a substitution of primary raw materials in ICT devices with secondary raw materials recovered from EoL consumer ICT devices on both indicator scores. According to our results, such a substitution leads to benefits which are highest for the base metals, followed by scarce metals. The recovery of secondary raw materials from EoL consumer ICT devices can significantly reduce the need for primary raw materials and subsequently the material rucksacks and related impacts. However, increased recycling is not a panacea: the current rapid growth of the materials stock in the technosphere necessitates continuous natural resource depletion, and recycling itself is ultimately limited by thermodynamics.},

The objective of the present study is to provide estimates for the 2020 use stage electricity consumption and ICT sector's total lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions divided in three main parts: user devices including internet-of-things, networks and data centers. The study builds on a high number of data sources including measured and reported data from 150 companies that is estimated to cover about 80\% of network subscriptions, about 55\% of data center electricity, and about 35\% of upstream GHG emissions. To understand the development, the results are put into the perspective of earlier studies. In conclusion, the ICT sector used about 4\% of the global electricity in the use stage and represented about 1.4\% of the global GHG emissions in 2020. The use stage electricity consumption and the total GHG emissions have increased since 2015, but the impact per subscription has decreased. The user devices accounted for over half of all GHG emissions, with equal parts relating to use stage and other lifecycle stages. For networks and data centers, the use stage GHG emissions are dominating. The electricity consumption and GHG emissions are also estimated for the closely related areas Entertainment and Media (including e.g., TVs), paper media, and cryptocurrencies.},

The metal content of the 7.42 billion smartphone devices sold from 2012 to 2017 could theoretically maintain the global supply for 91 days for Ga, 73 days for Ta, 23 days for Pd, 14 days for Au, and 6 days for REE. The pure metal value of a single smartphone device for the investigated metals currently sums to 1.13 US \$; it averaged at 1.05 US \$ from 2012 to 2017 with the highest value of 1.32 US \$ in 2012. The Au content is low (16.83 mg per device), yet constitutes the highest value with a current share of approximately 72\% of total value for all measured metals, followed by Pd (10\%). Approximately 82\% of total metal value can be recycled with current standard recycling methods for Au, Cu, Pd, Pt, which only comprise 6 wt\% of the total device. The printed circuit board (pcb) contains 90\% of the measured Au, 98\% of Cu, 99\% of Pd, 86\% of In, and 93\% of Ta. The Au, Pd, Cu, Pt, Ta, In, Ga contents in a smartphone pcb are significantly higher than the metal content in currently mined ores. Magnets contain 96\% of the measured REE and 40\% of the measured Ga, with higher concentrations than ores for REE and Ga. For Co and Ge, metal content in smartphones (w/o batteries) is lower than in ores.},

In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data permit, the activity of the wealthy (OECD) countries, those countries with emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated. The dominant feature of the socio-economic trends is that the economic activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate. However, the differentiated graphs clearly show that strong equity issues are masked by considering global aggregates only. Most of the population growth since 1950 has been in the non-OECD world but the world’s economy (GDP), and hence consumption, is still strongly dominated by the OECD world. The Earth System indicators, in general, continued their long-term, post-industrial rise, although a few, such as atmospheric methane concentration and stratospheric ozone loss, showed a slowing or apparent stabilisation over the past decade. The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the effect of digitalization on energy consumption. Using an analytical model, we investigate four effects: (1) direct effects from the production, usage and disposal of information and communication technologies (ICT), (2) energy efficiency increases from digitalization, (3) economic growth from increases in labor and energy productivities and (4) sectoral change/tertiarization from the rise of ICT services. The analysis combines empirical and theoretical findings from debates on decoupling energy consumption from economic growth and from debates on green IT and ICT for sustainability. Our main results: Effects 1 and 3 tend to increase energy consumption. Effects 2 and 4 tend to decrease it. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the two increasing effects prevail so that, overall, digitalization increases energy consumption. These results can be explained by four insights from ecological economics: (a) physical capital and energy are complements in the ICT sector, (b) increases in energy efficiency lead to rebound effects, (c) ICT cannot solve the difficulty of decoupling economic growth from exergy, (d) ICT services are relatively energy intensive and come on top of former production. In future, digitalization can only boost sustainability when it fosters effects 2 and 4 without promoting effects 1 and 3.},

This sense of entitlement simultaneously frames suicide as an appropriate, instrumental behaviour for these males to underscore their violent enactment of masculinity.

My analysis complicates culturalist narratives, but engages critically with culture as one context within which violence is embedded. Drawing on field research within Muslim communities in Hyderabad, India, I discuss the complexities of interwoven experiences of structural, state, and intimate gender violence. I draw attention to how anti-violence organizations working in marginalized communities theorize these complexities, and practices of what I am calling ‘plural resistance,’ which these organizations enact through equally complex responses to such violences. Plural resistance describes community-based strategies that simultaneously reject both gender violence and other forms of systemic violence, such as poverty born of uneven development. Embodied resistance to gender violence provides a critical lens for understanding articulations between regional patriarchies, exclusionary state practices, uneven development, and Islamophobia.},

Many elided the difficulty by calling it homophobic terrorism, but this could not resolve the tension.

Instead, this article argues, these two frames should not be taken as cause and effect but as problems that share a common ailment: the presence of toxic masculinities. Beginning from a position that sees masculinity as constituted through violence in patriarchal culture, this article works through the idea that when there is a disillusionment with violence, masculinity under patriarchy turns toxic. What emerges then is not merely violence but “rage” as the praxis of toxic masculinities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Both violences operate through emotional and psychological registers that are as central to their effectiveness as incidents of direct physical harm. While these dynamics are intimate, they are present across scale, and read here through a feminist lens on intimacy-geopolitics where neither framing has primacy. Research on the connections between domestic violence and international warfare is longstanding, most recently highlighting how intimate violence is produced within warzones. The analysis here begins instead from intimate dynamics, to draw out the warlike nature of domestic violence in peacetime. Tactics of modern warfare are juxtaposed with the dynamics of domestic violence in suburban Scottish homes: shock and awe, hearts and minds, cultural and psychological occupation, just war and collateral damage. Resisting the temptation to regard domestic violence as everyday militarism, the relation is rotated: both violences continuously wind through the intimate-geopolitical. This spatial reconfiguration is structured by gender, race, class, nation and citizenship, resulting in uneven impacts from all kinds of intimate war. The interweaving of military and intimate themes is intended as a casting-off point for progressing political geographies that are attentive to intimacy as foundational in the workings of power across scale.},

Feminist geopolitics is not an alternative theory of geopolitics, nor the ushering in of a new spatial order, but is an approach to global issues with feminist politics in mind. ‘Feminist’ in this context refers to analyses and political interventions that address the unequal and often violent relationships among people based on real or perceived differences. Building upon the literature from critical geopolitics, feminist international relations, and transnational feminist studies, I develop a framework for feminist political engagement. The paper interrogates concepts of human security and juxtaposes them with state security, arguing for a more accountable, embodied, and responsive notion of geopolitics. A feminist geopolitics is sought by examining politics at scales other than that of the nation-state; by challenging the public/private divide at a global scale; and by analyzing the politics of mobility for perpetrators of crimes against humanity. As such, feminist geopolitics is a critical approach and a contingent set of political practices operating at scales finer and coarser than the nation-state.},

It shows what some of features of conflict and conflict resolution are and describes relations between them that suggest a continuum of violence. Gender power is seen to shape the dynamics of every site of human interaction, from the household to the international arena. A gender analysis reveals imbalanced sex distributions. The economic distress, militarization, and divisive shifts in ideology are considered. It then explores the three manifestly gendered elements of war: mobilization into the armed forces; the catastrophic disruption of everyday life; and brutalization of the body. The three aspects of postconflict situations are explored: displacement; economic and social reconstruction; and aid, justice, and reconciliation. The power imbalance of gender relations in most societies generates cultures of masculinity prone to violence.},

	abstract = {Building on feminist geopolitics and emotional geography, this paper calls for an emotional electoral geography that understands electoral practices as grounded, embodied and intertwined with the time-spatial context in which electioneering takes ‘place’. I argue that a performative understanding of emotions not only facilitates linking emotions to certain places, histories and (collective) bodies, but also helps to think of emotions as expressed both through body and speech acts. Empirically, the paper draws on visual ethnographic fieldwork of a local electoral campaign in an Amazon town in Ecuador. The observed emotional performances of female and indigenous local politicians are compared with the emotional performances of national populists who are mainly mestizo men and have dominated Ecuadorian politics throughout the past decades. The research identifies similar emotional patterns turning around a Manichean rhetoric of rabia (rage) and amor (love). The comparison shows, however, that the emotional performances of different candidates performatively generate the gendered, racialized and classed boundaries of el pueblo in different ways in particular times and places. The empirical case study illustrates the claim that electoral geographies need to be more attentive to the emotional dimension of electoral spaces to understand the affective dimension of contemporary populist politics.},

From the detailed, online maps of the Brexit vote to discussions of the electoral college versus the popular vote in the 2016 Trump–Clinton U.S. presidential contest, the relationships among geography, voting, and political power have seldom been more visible. The popularity of electoral geography in social and news media, however, does not necessarily reflect its presence in scholarly discussions, and indeed, in some ways, the former has replaced the latter. Digital technology and the burgeoning availability of electronic data mean that it is easier than ever to create maps of votes, often in near real time. Yet the academic field of electoral geography encompasses more than just mapping votes, including the study of election campaigns, political parties, electoral systems, and gerrymandering. The 3 major approaches are the geography of voting (mapping and visualizing votes), geographic influences on voting (the effect of place on political preferences and behavior), and the geography of representation (the analysis of electoral systems). Indeed, the structure of the electoral system, including gerrymandering, is often the key to understanding how political and racial/ethnic minorities can (or cannot) wield power and influence. This article examines each approach after a brief review of the historical origins of the subfield.},

Each of these topics is covered in a chapter which contrasts the contemporary nature of globalization with that of earlier epochs. In mapping the shape and political consequences of globalization, the authors concentrate on six states in advanced capitalist societies (SIACS): the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, Germany, and Japan. For comparative purposes, other states—particularly those with developing economics—are referred to and discussed where relevant. The book concludes by systematically describing and assessing contemporary globalization, and appraising the implications of globalization for the sovereignty and autonomy of SIACS. It also confronts directly the political fatalism that surrounds much discussion of globalization with a normative agenda that elaborates the possibilities for democratizing and civilizing the unfolding global transformation.},

	abstract = {In the midst of the current global turn to the right, striking resonances across oceans emerge: strongmen and their allies point to specific and vivid tales or images signaling demographic shifts as signs of danger. These could be lesbian farmers (supposedly) staging a takeover of the US Midwest, tales of virtuous headscarf-wearing women under attack by secular men (in Turkey), or of Muslim Romeos luring Hindu women to convert (in India). In each of these cases, the story lodges in the body and takes on a life of its own, inspiring fear and devotion, and centering the need for a heroic rescue. Here, we argue for the need for feminist engagement with political narratives about population change and point to the important work that fantastical stories focused on demographically based fears have done for the recent rise of right-wing politics in the United States, India, and Turkey. We refer to these stories as demographic fever dreams to emphasize their simultaneous obsession with demography and detachment from demographic data. Our analysis shows that demographic fever dreams deploy gendered tropes to create a narrative of vulnerability for dominant groups in relation to a takeover by religious, racial, and sexual others. Attending to the discursive constitution of demographic fever dreams in media and by political leaders in each context, we examine how they effectively invoke populist fears and identify which bodies become threatening and which ones need protection. We show that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, Donald Trump in the United States, and Narendra Modi in India have all deployed an imaginary of an authentic nation under threat—whether that is racialized as the white working class in the United States or given religious inflection as authentically Sunni in Turkey and authentically Hindu in India. This imaginary becomes a fetishized group under threat from all manner of others threatening demographic destruction. In each of these instances, we argue that figures with political power use a vivid and fantastic fiction to amplify, imagine, and obscure demographic patterns of migration, birth, or mortality so as to consolidate political power or to dismiss and undermine class tensions and create fictitious communities of homogeneity. Thus, demographic fever dreams effectively produce a rationale for strongman masculinity and contribute to the retrenchment of nationalist values.},

Steffen Mau zeigt, dass Grenzen im Zeitalter der Globalisierung von Anbeginn nicht offener gestaltet, sondern zu machtvollen Sortiermaschinen umgebaut wurden. Während ein kleiner Kreis Privilegierter heute nahezu überallhin reisen darf, bleibt die große Mehrheit der Weltbevölkerung weiterhin systematisch außen vor. Während die Mobilität von Menschen über Grenzen hinweg in den letzten Jahrzehnten stetig zunahm und Grenzen immer offener schienen, fand gleichzeitig eine in Wissenschaft und Öffentlichkeit unterschätzte Gegenentwicklung statt. Vielerorts ist es zu einer neuen Fortifizierung gekommen, zum Bau neuer abschreckender Mauern und militarisierter Grenzübergänge. Grenzen wurden zudem immer selektiver und - unterstützt durch die Digitalisierung - zu Smart Borders aufgerüstet. Und die Grenzkontrolle hat sich räumlich massiv ausgedehnt, ja ist zu einer globalen Unternehmung geworden, die sich vom Territorium ablöst. Der Soziologe Steffen Mau analysiert, auf welche Weise und mit welchen Mitteln die neuen Sortiermaschinen Mobilität und Immobilität zugleich schaffen: Für erwünschte Reisende sollen sich Grenzen wie Kaufhaustüren öffnen, für andere sollen sie fester denn je verschlossen bleiben. Nirgends tritt das Janusgesicht der Globalisierung deutlicher zutage als an den Grenzen des 21. Jahrhunderts.

Therefore, working with film is suitable as a teaching format that enables co-production of knowledge and transformative learning. Through participatory filmmaking, students can acquire transdisciplinary competencies, which

 by debates on transformative teaching and participatory filmmaking, we show how we used the social learning video method to teach transdisciplinary competencies in a university setting. Using the design of future railway stations as an example, students interacted with external practice partners
 in real-world problem situations. As part of this process, they became aware of their own professional perspectives and critically reflected on the perspectives of their practice partners and the differences in their understanding of sustainability. In addition, they developed numerous transdisciplinary
 competences, such as defining a problem together, conducting group discussions and interviews, mediating among different viewpoints, allowing a common language to develop, and triggering “AHA!” moments in joint film screenings. As part of transdisciplinary and transformative teaching,
 it is important to provide access to external practice partners and working environments, enable students to engage and reflect, and provide nurturing and challenging framework conditions.},

	abstract = {Participatory research can change the view of children from research subjects to active partners. As active partners, children can be recognized as agents who can contribute to different steps of the research process. However, “participatory research” is an umbrella term that covers both the collection of data with children and children’s participation in making decisions related to the research process. As such, it raises particular challenges for researchers. Based on a pragmatic ethics approach, we were inspired by the realist review methodology to synthesize the current literature, identify different strategies used to engage children aged 12 and below in participatory research, and analyze how they affect children’s active participation and the ethical aspects related to each. Fifty-seven articles were retained for inclusion in the review. A variety of strategies were used to involve children in the research process, including discussion groups, training/capacity-building sessions, photography and filming, children as data collectors and questionnaires. The most prevalent ethical considerations identified were related to power dynamics and strategies to facilitate children’s expression and foster the authenticity of children’s voices. Researchers should address these ethical considerations to actively involve children within the research process and prevent tokenistic participation. Active inclusion of children in research could include co-identifying with them how they want to be involved in knowledge production (if they want to) from the beginning of a project.},

	abstract = {There is a lack of theoretical and empirical studies regarding social sustainability. The literature reveals that the “social” was integrated late into debates on sustainable development. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a new conceptual framework of social sustainability. We suggest that risk is a constitutive concept of sustainability and that the contemporary conditions of risk resulting primarily from climate change and its ensuing uncertainties pose serious social, spatial, structural, and physical threats to contemporary human societies and their living spaces. Within the framework of sustainability, we propose that social sustainability strives to confront risk while addressing social concerns. Although we agree that without socially oriented practices, efforts to achieve sustainability will be undermined, as too many gaps exist in practice and theory. Thus, we propose a comprehensive Conceptual Framework of Social Sustainability, which is composed of four interrelated concepts of socially oriented practices, where each concept has a distinctive function in the framework and incorporates major social aspects. The concept of Equity encompasses three dimensions: recognition, which “revalues unjustly devalued identities”, redistribution, which suggests that the remedy for injustice is some form of economic restructuring, and parity of participation, which promotes substantive public involvement in the production of space. These efforts may, in turn, reduce alienation and enhance civility and a sense of community and place attachment. The concept of Safety is the ontological foundation of sustainability in general and social sustainability in particular. The concept refers to the right to not only be safe but adopt all measures of adaptation and security to prevent future casualties and physical harm. The concept of Eco-prosumption refers to modes of producing and gaining values in socially and environmentally responsible ways. The concept of Urban Forms represents the physical dimensions of socially desired urban and community physical forms. Eventually, a desired physical form should promote a sense of community, safety, health, and place attachment, among other environmental objectives.},

The Mosaic approach has been applied by practitioners throughout the world. This second edition reflects on the authors' original ground-breaking work, with new introductions, updates and examples of how the Mosaic approach has been adapted, and offers case studies that will encourage practitioners to use the framework in their own setting. 

Listening to Young Children will be of interest to policy makers, practitioners in nurseries, children's centres, pre-schools and schools and residential settings. It will also be welcomed by early childhood students and other researchers who are engaged in searching for new theoretical, practical and imaginative ways of listening to young children.},

They treat it as a craft. They are professionals. In The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice-about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act. Readers will learn What it means to behave as a true software craftsman How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers How to get into the flow of coding, and get past writer's block How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms How to manage your time, and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive When to say "No”-and how to say it When to say "Yes”-and what yes really means Great software is something to marvel at: powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as both a developer and as a user. Great software isn't written by machines. It is written by professionals with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. The Clean Coder will help you become one of them-and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess."},

	title = {Substratkartierung in alpinen Ökosystemen mit {Deep}-{Learning}- {Objektdetektoren}},
	abstract = {Die Bedeutung von Wasser und Gewässer ist unbestritten. Die Funktion als Trinkwasser für Mensch
und Tier liegt auf der Hand. Flüsse und Seen bieten zudem vielen Lebewesen Nahrung und Schutz
und für den Menschen oftmals beliebte Naherholungsgebiete. Dem gegenüber steht die Stromproduktion
aus Wasserkraft wie auch die industrielle und landwirtschaftliche Nutzung. Im Gewässerschutzrecht
definiert der Bund den umfassenden Schutz der Gewässer und ihrer vielfältigen Funktionen
sowie die nachhaltig abgestimmte Nutzung durch den Menschen als zentrale Ziele. Bauten
und Anlagen des Menschen stellen unweigerlich einen Eingriff dar. Durch Hochwasserereignisse,
Sturzfluten oder Wasserabflüsse aus Kraftwerksanlagen wird dieses sensible Ökosystem zusätzlich
belastet. Besonders in alpinen Regionen können durch ausserordentliche Ereignisse grosse Geschiebevolumen
die natürliche Ordnung im Gewässer stören, das ökologische Gleichgewicht negativ
verändern und die Nutzung bspw. für die Stromproduktion beeinträchtigen. Solche Veränderungen
müssen effektiv und genau dokumentiert werden, um daraus Massnahmen zur Verbesserung
abzuleiten.
Das Substrat ist ein Schlüsselindikator für den ökologischen Zustand eines Gewässers. Konventionelle
Substratkartierungen basieren auf manuellen Feldkartierungen und Linienzahlanalysen.
Ansätze für die Erfassung mit Laserscanning und Luftbildaufnahmen bestehen, stützen sich aber für
die Substratableitung meistens auf geometrische Eigenschaften wie die Rauigkeit und selten auf
Einzelbildklassifikationen ab. Grossflächige Kartierungen mit automatisierten bildbasierten Verfahren
sind nicht vorhanden.
In dieser Arbeit wurden bildbasierte Deep-Learning-Objektdetektoren zur Substratkartierung mit
georeferenzierten Bilddaten untersucht. Zwei durchgängige Workflows mit unterschiedlichen Detektionsansätzen
(Workflow A mit einer Objektdetektion, Workflow B mit einer Semantischen Segmentation)
konnten erstellt, die Netzwerke trainiert und angewendet werden. Weiter wurden die Anforderungen
an das Bildmaterial getestet und die Detektionsresultate mit Referenzverteilungen aus
einer manuellen Kartierung sowie einer Kartierung nach geometrischen Eigenschaften verglichen.
In den Workflows wird georeferenziertes Bildmaterial von lokal gespeicherten Orthophotos aus
Drohnenaufnahmen oder vom WMS-Dienst SWISSIMAGE der swisstopo zusammen mit Trainingsdaten
aufbereitet und in ein neuronales Netzwerk für das Training und die Detektion eingespiesen.
Detektionen werden als georeferenzierte Flächen im Shape-Format ausgegeben und können direkt
weiterverarbeitet werden. Die Workflows sind als geodaten- und MultiClass-fähige open-source Anwendungen
in Python und auf Google Colaboratory für den breiten Einsatz umgesetzt.
In Zusammenarbeit mit der Kraftwerke Oberhasli AG (KWO) und auf Basis ihrer Grundlage- und
Trainingsdaten konnte ein Versuchsaufbau im Gadmental realisiert werden.
Mit diesem Versuchsaufbau konnte die Leistungsfähigkeit der Workflows und der verwendeten Detektionsansätzen
an unterschiedlichen Bodenauflösungen (3cm, 5cm, 10cm, 25cm) und Bildquellen
(lokale Orthophotos, SWISSIMAGE) überprüft werden. Für Workflow A Objektdetektion wurde Detectron2/
ResNet50 und für Workflow B Semantische Segmentation U-Net/MobileNet\_v2 und UNet/
ResNet50 verwendet. Ein Trainingseffekt mit vergleichbaren Genauigkeitswerten konnte bei beiden
Workflows besonders bei hohen Auflösungen beobachtet werden. Die visuelle Betrachtung der
Detektion zeigt für hohe Auflösungen plausible Resultate. Bereiche mit niedrigen Wasserständen
werden erkannt und Vegetation oder tiefe Bereiche konsequent ausgeschieden. Vereinzelt sind fehlende
Detektionen in dunklen/schattigen Bereichen erkennbar.
Für die Beurteilung des ökologischen Gewässerzustandes ist die Verteilung der Substratflächen
entscheidend. Eine Histogrammgegenüberstellung der detektierten Flächen mit einer manuellen digitalisierten
Referenzverteilung sowie einer Verteilung anhand von geometrischen Rauigkeitsindikatoren
über Teilabschnitte zeigt, dass eine Semantische Segmentation mit ResNet50 die Referenzverteilung
am treffensten nachmodellieren kann. Eine Verschlechterung mit abnehmender Bodenauflösung
ist auch hier feststellbar.
Die entwickelten Workflows funktionieren und die offene Umsetzung ist zielführend. Die Semantische
Segmentation mit ResNet50 bei 3cm Bodenauflösung zeigt bereits jetzt erfolgsversprechende
Resultate, während ab 5cm eine starke Abnahme der Leistung auftritt. Die Validierung anhand der
Referenzverteilung zeigt, dass die Eignung von bildbasierten Deep-Learning-Ansätzen für die Substratkartierung
gegeben ist. Dies ermöglicht einen kleinen Beitrag für eine bessere ökologische Beurteilung
von Gewässern sowie zielgerichtete und ressourcenschonende Verbesserungsmassnahmen.},

	abstract = {A range of regulated gene expression systems has been developed for mycobacteria in the last few years to facilitate the study of essential genes, validate novel drug targets and evaluate their vulnerability. Among these, the TetR/Pip-OFF repressible promoter system was successfully used in several mycobacterial species both in vitro and in vivo. In the first version of the system, the repressible promoter was Pptr, a strong Pip-repressible promoter of Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, which might hamper effective downregulation of genes with a low basal expression level. Here, we report an enhanced system that allows more effective control of genes expressed at low level. To this end, we subjected Pptr to targeted mutagenesis and produced 16 different promoters with different strength. Three of them, weaker than the wild-type promoter, were selected and characterized showing that they can indeed improve the performances of TetR/Pip-OFF repressible system both in vitro and in vivo increasing its stringency. Finally, we used these promoters to construct a series of bacterial biosensors with different sensitivity to DprE1 inhibitors and developed a whole-cell screening assay to identify inhibitors of this enzyme.},

(Economic) geography has been slow to take up the vibrant debates in anthropology, sociology, gender studies, and other neighboring disciplines on assisted reproductive technologies and their effects on society, kinship, and reproduction. In this paper, I argue that an analysis of the fast-growing transnational market of assisted reproduction has much to gain from economic geographies with their interest in the making of markets across borders and feminist economic geographers' engagement with how new forms of gendered and racialized divisions of labor intersect with particular economic, cultural, political, and social contexts. I discuss literature on assisted reproductive technologies and their transnational economies against the background of these two issues—the transnational making of fertility markets and the global division of reproductive labor along axes of gender, race, class, and nationality. The conclusion points out the need for articulating geographies of assisted reproduction that integrate a geographic perspective into the study of assisted reproductive technologies and reproductive economic geographies that push the boundaries of economic geography towards the economies of (assisted) reproduction.},

	abstract = {In the Amazon Rainforest, a unique post-carbon plan to mitigate global warming and to protect the exceptional bio-cultural diversity was experimented in 2007–2013 by the Ecuadorian government. To preserve the rainforest ecosystems within the Yasuní-ITT oil block, the release of 410 million metric tons of CO2 would have been avoided. The neologism “yasunization” emerged as an Amazonian narrative on “unburnable carbon” to be replicated worldwide. Considering the unburnable carbon, petroleum-associated gas flaring represents the unleakable part. Flaring is an irrational practice that consists of burning waste gases, representing not only a leak of energy but also a pollution source. The general aim of the paper is to monitor gas flaring as a tool, revealing, at the same time, the implementation of environmental technologies in the oil sector and the compliance of sustainable policies in the Amazon region and the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve. Specific objectives are: (i) identifying and estimating gas flaring over seven years (2012–2018); (ii) mapping new flaring sites; iii) estimating potentially affected areas among ecosystems and local communities. We processed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Nightfire annual dataset, based on the elaboration of imagery from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and developed a GIS-based novel simple method to identify new flaring sites from daily detections. We found that 23.5\% of gas flaring sites and 18.4\% of volumes of all oil industries operating in Ecuador are located within the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve (YBR). Moreover, we detected 34 additional flaring sites not included in the NOAA dataset—12 in the YBR and one in Tiputini field, a key area for biological and cultural diversity conservation. We also found that at least 10 indigenous communities, 18 populated centers and 10 schools are located in the potentially affected area. Gas flaring can be used as a policy indicator to monitor the implementation of sustainable development practices in complex territories.},

	abstract = {Persistent poverty, economic decay, and lack of opportunities are at the root of considerable discontent in declining and lagging-behind areas the world over. Poor development prospects and an increasing belief that these places have ‘no future’ – as economic dynamism has been posited to be increasingly dependent on agglomeration economies – have led many of these so-called ‘places that don’t matter’ to revolt against the status quo. The revolt has come via an unexpected source: the ballot-box in a wave of political populism with strong territorial, rather than social foundations. I will argue that the populist wave is challenging the sources of existing well-being in both the less-dynamic and the more prosperous areas and that better, rather than more, place-sensitive territorial development policies are needed in order to find a solution to the problem. Place-sensitive development policies need, however, to stay clear of the welfare, income-support, and big investment projects of past development strategies if they are to be successful and focus on tapping into untapped potential and on providing opportunities to those people living in the places that ‘don’t matter’.},

	abstract = {The Ecuadorian proposal to keep 846 million barrels of crude oil in the Yasuní National Park underground—for the purposes of avoiding CO2 emissions and to protect both the biological diversity and the indigenous peoples in isolation who inhabit this area of the Amazon—is evaluated from a “multi-criteria” analysis. The main purpose of the paper is to compare this policy option with other alternatives across different values. An analytical framework is used that recognises the inherent complexity of a problem of this nature, in which the financial values are indeed relevant for policy, but other values are also relevant: the economic (in a broad sense), social, environmental, cultural and political. The results confirm that from a financial standpoint, extracting the oil is preferable, but by incorporating the non-monetary values into the multi-criteria decision process, one can plausibly defend the Yasuní-ITT Initiative as the most desirable policy option. Indeed, the social and environmental benefits (or “criteria”) signalling an economic transition towards a model based on renewable sources of energy, along with the protection of critical environmental and social capital, make up for the financial gap.},

Using border thinking, this paper brings Feminist Science and Technology Studies, Decolonial Theory, and Feminist Political Ecology into conversation with human geography to stress how a Feminist Decolonial Geography is well suited to tackle climate change. This approach can trace the origin of dominant ideas around climate change and enunciate their location, challenging normative, disembodied, and universal claims. By delineating the power relationships that transform people into hierarchical categories, we can trace the socio-environmental relationships that also contribute to climate change. The identification of exclusionary structures and rules to participate in climate science and beyond can elucidate opportunities to create a more equitable knowledge base. Border crossers represent opportunities to expand our epistemological canon. To resolve the climate crisis, we must adopt the navigating and negotiating skills of border crossers, hybrid, and bilingual world travelers. An essential vantage point to resolve the climate crisis.},

	abstract = {Global North migration studies have historically been marked by colonising discourses partially stemming from methodological nationalism tendencies and a limited engagement with the body. In particular, Anglophone studies on intimate partner violence against migrant women have largely reproduced problematic gendered culturalist representations, which may be symptomatic of a methodological scarcity of research with, for and/or by – rather than about migrants. Expanding on methodological attempts to counter these trends, this paper proposes a decolonial feminist geographical praxis for migration studies, which builds on existing efforts to decolonise feminist geographical methodologies. Travelling Cuerpo-Territorios is a travelling methodology to conduct decolonial feminist geographical research with migrant women. As a Brazilian woman researching Latin American women’s experiences of intimate and state violence(s) and resistance in England, I implemented this methodology in a Global North context of COVID-19 restrictions. Mobilising and adapting Cuerpo-Territorio (“Body-Territory”), as an embodied Latin American ontology and as a method, I methodologically advance critical migration studies and feminist geopolitics’ perspectives towards a decolonial direction. This approach decolonises migration research by proposing a multi-scalar methodological framework that centres on a decolonial feminist understanding of the body, as the first territory-scale of analysis and from which knowledge is critically produced.},
